One day a rich young ruler came up to Jesus and asked him, “Good teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?” Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? There is only One who is good, and that is God. But if you want to have eternal life, obey God’s laws.”

Amêsên, dilag gisay liyaki ya nagtungkulan ya namatang kan Jesus, sinabi na, “Mangêd da Manuru, sabêt ta sêpat kun daygên amên mabiyan nakun biyay ya ayin katganan?” 

Nakitbay si Jesus kana, “Awta binêg muku yan mangêd ta? Ayin kaatag ga mangêd nun a kay si Bapan Namalyari.

“Which ones?” he asked. Jesus replied, “Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not lie. Honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as you love yourself.”

Tanda muy mani utus Bapan Namalyari, ‘Agana ka manganayun, agana ka mamati, agana ka manakaw, agana ka magpapêtêg sa alwan kapêtêgan, buy galangên muy bapa mu buy indu mu.”’

The young man, trying to prove that he was right, said, “I have obeyed all these laws ever since I was a boy. What do I still need to do?” Jesus looked at him and loved him.

21 Nakitbay ya liyaki ya nagtungkulan, “Ubat pun sa anak kaku, sinunul kinay kaganawan abiin angga amêsên.”

Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, then go and sell everything you own and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure waiting for you in heaven. Then come and follow me.”

Sên nalêngên Jesus ya sinabin nagtungkulan, sinabi na kana, “Gisa pun na a mu nadyag. Isaliw muy kaganawan pibandiyan mu buy si pera naabli mu, idin mu sa mani kalulu. Sa kapamilatan abaytu, mabiyan kan pibandiyan sa langit. Pamakayari, mag-udung ka buy sumunul ka kangku.”

When the young man heard this, he became very sad, because he was very rich. He turned and went away from Jesus, unwilling to give up his wealth.

Nuwa sên nalêngên nagtungkulan na sinabin Jesus, nalungkut ya, tagawan mabandi ya.

Then Jesus said to his disciples, “How hard it is for rich people to enter into the Kingdom of God! Yes, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.”

Sên nakitan Jesus ya nalungkut ta nagtungkulan, sinabi na, “Ya mani tawuy mabandi, masakit silan misun sa pag-arin Bapan Namalyari. Tambêng pun misun na gisay kamelyu sa lubut karayum, kaysa magpasakup pa mabandi sa pag-arin Bapan Namalyari.”

When the disciples heard this they were shocked and said, “Then who can be saved?”

Amêsên, namatang nga mani tawuy nakalêngê sa sinabin Jesus, “Nu parabaydu, sisabêt ta malyarin miligtas buy miawyun sa pag-arian Bapan Namalyari?” 

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-28-08.jpg}}

Jesus looked at them and said, “With people this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible.”

Nakitbay si Jesus kalla, “Ya asê madyag tawu, madyag yan Bapan Namalyari.”

Peter said to Jesus, “We have left everything and followed you. What will be our reward?”

Amêsên, sinabin Pedru, “Parasaantu kay yaman na tagasunul mu? Inlakwanan yan nay kaganawan amên sumunul kamu.”

Jesus answered, “Everyone who has left houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children, or property for my name’s sake, will inherit 100 times more in the next world and also eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first.”

Nakitbay si Jesus, “Pakalêng-ên yuy ati. Nu sisabêt man na manlakwan bali' na, asawa na, mapatêl na, mangatwa na, buy maanak na gawan sa pag-arin Bapan Namalyari, mabiyan yan igit pun kaysa sa inlakwanan na sa panawun amên. Buy sa panawun na lumatêng, makatanggap ya êt biyay ya ayin katganan.”
