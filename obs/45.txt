{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-45-01.jpg}}

One of the leaders in the early Church was a man named Stephen. He had a good reputation and was full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom. Stephen did many miracles and reasoned persuasively that people should believe in Jesus.

Si Esteban  gisa  ya sa mani  pinunun  nunan manampalatayay miaawyun. Pikatandan  yan manged  da tawu,  biyasa  ya buy  pan-awyunan yan Ispiritun Bapan Namalyari.  Malakey nay dinyag Esteban  ya  mamakaupapas. Pawa nan pansabin  sa mani tawuy kaylangan lan magtiwala kan Jesus.

One day, when Stephen was teaching about Jesus, some Jews who did not believe in Jesus began to argue with Stephen. They became very angry and lied about Stephen to the religious leaders. They said, "We heard him speak evil things about Moses and God!" So the religious leaders arrested Stephen and brought him to the high priest and the other leaders of the Jews, where more false witnesses lied about Stephen.

Gisay allu, nakisubakan si Esteban  sa dakun umnuy Judiu ya ase maniwala kan Jesus.  Nanubag sila kan Esteban.  Naglaram sila tungkul kan  Esteban.  Sinabi la, “ Nalenge yan yay  magsabin nadawak  tungkul kan  Moises buy  tungkul kan Bapan Namalyari!” Kabay  dinakep la si  Esteban.  Gintan la si Esteban  sa  pinakapuun pari  buy sa mani  pinunun mani Judiu.

The high priest asked Stephen, "Are these things true?" Stephen replied by reminding them of many of the great things God had done from the time of Abraham to the time of Jesus, and how God's people continually disobeyed him. Then he said, "You stubborn and rebellious people always reject the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors always rejected God and killed his prophets. But you did something worse than they did! You killed the Messiah!"

Pinatang puun pari si  esteban, “Peteg nayi ya pansabin la tungkul kamu?” Sinabin Esteban ya manganged da bagay ya dinyag  Bapan Namalyari sabitun panawun nan Abraham angga sa panawun Jesus.   Bayu  na sinabi, “ Mangakdey ya ulu yu.  A kaw kalabay manunul kan Bapan Namalyari,  pawa yun  ase pantanggapen na pangawyun  Ispiritun  Bapan  Namalyari.  Kaparisu kaw mani ninunu yu. Panpatin yuy mani propetan Bapan Namalyari. Sa kapetegan, pati ya  Mamiligtas ya  impagtan Bapan Namalyari impapati yu et.”

When the religious leaders heard this, they were so angry that they covered their ears and yelled loudly. They dragged Stephen out of the city and threw stones at him in order to kill him.

Sen  nalengen mani tawuy ati,  tinumpanan lay  mani tek la buy  nan-angaw masneg. Ginuluy la si  Esteban paawas sa  balayan. Baydu la binatwan si  Esteban angga sa  nati ya.

As Stephen was dying, he cried out, "Jesus, receive my spirit." Then he fell to his knees and cried out again, "Master, do not count this sin against them." Then he died.

Nuwa bayu nati si Esteban, nanalangin ya, “Jesus tanggapen muy  ispiritu ku.” Pamakayari nanguman yan nanduku, bayu nanalangin, “Panginuun, agana mu sila parusan sa dinyag la kangku.” Pamakasabi nan ati nati yina.

A young man named Saul agreed with the people who killed Stephen and guarded their robes while they threw stones at him. That day, many people in Jerusalem started persecuting the followers of Jesus, so the believers fled to other places. But in spite of this, they preached about Jesus everywhere they went.

Dilag gisay liyaki baydu ya nakiayun  sa  pamati kan Esteban. Binantayan nay mani gamit  mani tawuy namati kan Esteban. Si lagyu na  Saulo. Sabitun panawun abitu, malakey nay mani tawuy kalabay mamati sa  mani Cristiyanu. Kabay malakey Cristiyanuy nag-alis un tutugelan. Nuwa agyan dakun antuy lakwen la, pan-ikuwentu lay tungkul kan  Jesus sa mani tawuy makilala la.

A disciple of Jesus' named Philip was one of the believers who fled from Jerusalem during the persecution. He went to Samaria where he preached about Jesus and many people were saved. Then one day, an angel from God told Philip to go to a certain road in the desert. As he walked along the road, Philip saw an important official from Ethiopia riding in his chariot. The Holy Spirit told Philip to go and talk to this man.

Si Felipe gisa ya sa  mani  tagasunul Panginuun.  Naku ya sa Samaria  buy  baydu nan in-aral  ya tungkul kan Jesus. Malakey naniwala kan Jesus  sa Samaria.  Gisay allu,  in-utus  ang-el Panginuun  si Felipe, “ Maku  ka sa dan papakun sa Gaza.' Kaban mamita ya nakitan nay   gisay  nagtungkulan sa  Etopia ya nakasakay sa kalesa na.  Sinabin Ispiritun Bapan Namalyari kan Felipe ya  pakisabyan  nay nagtungkulan.

When Philip approached the chariot, he heard the Ethiopian reading from what the prophet Isaiah wrote. The man read, "They led him like a lamb to be killed, and as a lamb is silent, he did not say a word. They treated him unfairly and did not respect him. They took his life away from him."

Sen marani   ya si Felipe sa kalesa, nalenge nay  liyaki ya mamasan librun propeta Isaias. “Kaparisun tupa, patin ya,  nuwa aya nagsabi agyan kay perad.   A ya  binyanan katuynungan buy  panggalang.  Kingway biyay na.”

Philip asked the Ethiopian, "Do you understand what you are reading?" The Ethiopian replied, "No. I cannot understand it unless someone explains it to me. Please come and sit next to me. Was Isaiah writing about himself or someone else?"

Pinatang  Felipe  ya liyaki, “Mapukatan  mu nayin kayek ka pambasen mu?” Nakitbay ya  nagtungkulan , “ Aku yabay  mapukatan  na pambasen ku nu  ayin  mamipapukat kangku.  Kaksaw ka,  magsakay  ka.  Sa elew mu ,  sisabet ta pantukuyun Isaias? Kaatag ga tawu nayi o sarili na?”

Philip explained to the Ethiopian man that Isaiah was writing about Jesus. Philip also used other scriptures to tell him the good news about Jesus.

Impapukat kanan  Felipe ya si pantukun Isaias sabay ya Panginuun Jesus.  Nanabet pun et si Felipe un kaatag pun na kasulatan amen  maikuwentu sa nagtungkulan  sa Etiopa ya Manged da  Balita tungkul kan Jesus.

As Philip and the Ethiopian traveled, they came to some water. The Ethiopian said, "Look! There is some water! May I be baptized?" And he told the driver to stop the chariot.

Sen  nipadan sila sa gisay lugal la dilag lanem,  pinatang  nagtungkulan  si Felipe, “Atuwe! Naglanem baydu! Malyari  yakina nayin  magpabawtismu?” Buy pinatgen nay kalesa.

So they went down into the water, and Philip baptized the Ethiopian. After they came up out of the water, the Holy Spirit suddenly carried Philip away to another place where he continued telling people about Jesus.

Naku sila buy si Felipe sa lanem.  Baydu yan binawtismuwan Felipe.  Pamakayari nan  binawtismuwan na taga  Etopia,  gintan yan  Ispiritun Bapan Namalyari sa kaatag ga lugal.   Baydu insundun Felipe   ya pangaral   na tungkul kan Jesus.

The Ethiopian continued traveling toward his home, happy that he knew Jesus.

Buy nuli yaman na nagtungkulan sa Etipia.  Matula tula ya gawan nakilala na si Jesus.
