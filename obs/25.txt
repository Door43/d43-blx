Immediately after Jesus was baptized, the Holy Spirit led him out into the wilderness, where he fasted for forty days and forty nights. Then Satan came to Jesus and tempted him to sin.

Pamakayarin nabawtismuwan Jesus, tambêng yan pikilakun Ispiritun Bapan Namalyari sa kakyangan. Nag-ayunu ya baydu un apattapuy allu buy apattapuy yabi. Inlumatêng baydu si Satanas amên tuksun ya dayi.

Satan tempted Jesus by saying, "If you are the Son of God, turn these rocks into bread so you can eat!"

Sinabin Satanas, “Nu sikay nabay ya anak Bapan Namalyari, dat daygên mu wati bay kanên na mani batun ati.”

Jesus replied, "It is written in God's word, 'People do not only need bread in order to live, but they need every word that God speaks!'"

Nakitbay si Jesus, “Idi sa kasulatan, ‘Alwan kay sa kanên mabyay ya tawu nun a sa balang sabin Bapan Namalyari.”’

Then Satan took Jesus to the highest point on the Temple and said, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, because it is written, 'God will command his angels to carry you so your foot does not hit a stone.'"

Pamakayari pikilaku yan Satanas sa têngêl templun Jerusalem. Sinabi na, “Nu sikay nabay ya anak Bapan Namalyari, dat magnabu kati. Ta idi sa kasulatan, ‘I-utus Bapan Namalyari ya mani ang-el na ta sal-un laka amên asê midumpul la bitis mu sa batu.”’

But Jesus replied to Satan by quoting from the Scriptures. He said, "In God's Word, he commands his people, 'Do not test the Lord your God.'"

Nuwa nakitbay si Jesus, “Idi sa kasulatan, ‘Gana mu subukên na Panginuun mun Namalyari.”’

Then Satan showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and all their glory and said, "I will give you all this if you bow down and worship me."

Pamakayari, pikilaku yan Satanas sa matag-ay ya bung-uy buy impakit kanay kaganawan bansa buy kangêdan mani ati. Sinabi na, “Idin ku kamuy kaganawan abiin, nu manduku ka buy mangulimên kangku.”

Jesus replied, "Get away from me, Satan! In God's word he commands his people, 'Worship only the Lord your God and only serve him.'"

Nakitbay si Jesus, “Magtas kay, Satanas! Gawan idi sa kasulatan, ‘Kay Panginuun mun Bapan Namalyari ya sambên buy suywan mu.”’

Jesus did not give in to Satan's temptations, so Satan left him. Then angels came and took care of Jesus.

Asê natuksu si Jesus sa mani panuksun Satanas kana. Kabay inlakwanan yan Satanas. Inlumatêng ngaman na ang-el Bapan Namalyari buy nagsuyu kan Jesus.
