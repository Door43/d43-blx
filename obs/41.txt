After the soldiers crucified Jesus, the unbelieving Jewish leaders said to Pilate, "That liar, Jesus, said he would rise from the dead after three days. Someone must guard the tomb to make sure that his disciples do not steal the body and then say he has risen from the dead."

Sabitun nati si Jesus,  nakuy mani puun pari buy mani Pariseu kan Pilatu, “Sinabi la, “Gobernador naganaka yan na sabitun nabyay ya pun, sinabi nay “Pamakayarin tatluy allu mabyay yakun manguman.”

Pilate said, "Take some soldiers and make the tomb as secure as you can." So they placed a seal on the stone at the entrance of the tomb and put the soldiers there to make sure no one could steal the body.

Pikitbayan silan pilatu, “Dali.  Ipilmi yun ase mabuklat tawuy pinilbengan kana sa ikatluy allu.  Niutus sila et magbantay  amen maipilmi lan ase malimêd mani tagasunul Jesus ya  bangkay na .”

The day after Jesus was buried was a Sabbath day, and the Jews were not permitted to go to a tomb on that day. So very early on the morning after the Sabbath day, several women prepared to go to Jesus' tomb to put more burial spices on his body.

Sen sumunul la allu,   Alluy nan Pagpaynaway abitu kabay ase nilakuy mani tagasunul sa pamilbengan. Nuwa pamakawasak,   maranun  danun pun nakuy nay mani babayi sa pinilbengan kan  Jesus amen punwan  pabangi ya  lawinin  Jesus  amen  ase  bumata.

Suddenly, there was a great earthquake. An angel that shone as bright as lightning appeared from heaven. He rolled away the stone that was covering the entrance to the tomb and sat on it. The soldiers guarding the tomb were terrified and fell to the ground like dead men.

Bengat tan nangayun  kaban  papakun  sila sa pinilbengan.   Gisay   ang-el Panginuun ya  nagtabuy ubat sa langit.  Nanuwad  yan kimat ta mamakasilew.  Intuling  nay  batuy pinanakep sa pinilbengan buy nikun ya baydu.  Sadyay limun mani sundalus kabay  nabunsul silan kaganwan.

When the women arrived at the tomb, the angel told them, "Do not be afraid. Jesus is not here. He has risen from the dead, just like he said he would! Look in the tomb and see." The women looked into the tomb and saw where Jesus' body had been laid. His body was not there!

Sinabin ang-el  sa mani  babayi,  “Agana kaw malimu.  Ayin na baydi si Jesus.  Nabyay   yinan manguman, kaparisun sinabi na kamuyu.  Sumun kaw   buy elewen yu. “ Inelew mani babayi  ya pinikalekan kan Jesus.  Ayin  nabay baydu si  Jesus!

Then the angel told the women, "Go and tell the disciples, 'Jesus has risen from the dead and he will go to Galilee ahead of you.'"

Sinabin   ang-el  sa  mani babayi,”Sabin  yu   sa mani tagasunul la  nabyay yan  manguman  si Jesus buy  muna yina  kamuyu sa Galilea.

The women were full of fear and great joy. They ran to tell the disciples the good news.

Limu  buy  sayay matanam mani babayi.  Nuwayu silan  naku sa mani  tagasunul buy  ingkwentu lay nalyari.

As the women were on their way to tell the disciples the good news, Jesus appeared to them, and they worshiped him. Jesus said, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my disciples to go to Galilee. They will see me there."
