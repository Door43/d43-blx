After the soldiers crucified Jesus, the unbelieving Jewish leaders said to Pilate, "That liar, Jesus, said he would rise from the dead after three days. Someone must guard the tomb to make sure that his disciples do not steal the body and then say he has risen from the dead."

Sabitun nati si Jesus, nakuy mani puun pari buy mani Pariseu kan Pilatu, sinabi la, “Gobernador, naganaka yan na sabitun nabyay ya pun, sinabi nay 'Pamakayarin tatluy allu mabyay yakun manguman.'”

Pilate said, "Take some soldiers and make the tomb as secure as you can." So they placed a seal on the stone at the entrance of the tomb and put the soldiers there to make sure no one could steal the body.

Pikitbayan silan pilatu, “Dali, ipilmi yun asê mabuklat tawuy pinilbêngan kana sa ikatluy allu. Niutus sila et magbantay amên maipilmi lan asê malimêd mani tagasunul Jesus ya bangkay na.”

The day after Jesus was buried was a Sabbath day, and the Jews were not permitted to go to a tomb on that day. So very early on the morning after the Sabbath day, several women prepared to go to Jesus' tomb to put more burial spices on his body.

Sên sumunul la allu,  Alluy nan Pagpaynaway abitu kabay asê nilakuy mani tagasunul sa pamilbêngan. Nuwa pamakawasak, maranun-danun pun nakuy nay mani babayi sa pinilbêngan kan Jesus amên punwan pabangi ya lawinin  Jesus amên asê bumata.

Suddenly, there was a great earthquake. An angel that shone as bright as lightning appeared from heaven. He rolled away the stone that was covering the entrance to the tomb and sat on it. The soldiers guarding the tomb were terrified and fell to the ground like dead men.

Bêngat tan nangayun kaban papakun sila sa pinilbêngan. Gisay ang-el Panginuun ya nagtabuy ubat sa langit.  Nanuwad yan kimat ta mamakasilêw. Intuling nay batuy pinanakêp sa pinilbêngan buy nikun ya baydu.  Sadyay limun mani sundalus kabay nabunsul silan kaganwan.

When the women arrived at the tomb, the angel told them, "Do not be afraid. Jesus is not here. He has risen from the dead, just like he said he would! Look in the tomb and see." The women looked into the tomb and saw where Jesus' body had been laid. His body was not there!

Sinabin ang-el sa mani babayi, “Agana kaw malimu. Ayin na baydi si Jesus. Nabyay yinan manguman, kaparisun sinabi na kamuyu. Sumun kaw buy êlêwên yu.” Inêlêw mani babayi ya pinikalêkan kan Jesus. Ayin nabay baydu si  Jesus!

Then the angel told the women, "Go and tell the disciples, 'Jesus has risen from the dead and he will go to Galilee ahead of you.'"

Sinabin ang-el sa mani babayi, “Sabin yu sa mani tagasunul la nabyay yan manguman si Jesus buy muna yina  kamuyu sa Galilea.”

The women were full of fear and great joy. They ran to tell the disciples the good news.

Limu buy sayay matanam mani babayi. Nuwayu silan naku sa mani tagasunul buy ingkwentu lay nalyari.

As the women were on their way to tell the disciples the good news, Jesus appeared to them, and they worshiped him. Jesus said, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my disciples to go to Galilee. They will see me there."

Kaban idi sa dan, nagpakit kalla si Jesus. Inulimên lay ati. Sinabin Jesus, “Agana kaw malimu. Sabin yu sa mani tagasunul ku ya mikit kay tana sa Galilea.”
