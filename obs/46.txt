Saul was the young man who guarded the robes of the men who killed Stephen. He did not believe in Jesus, and so he persecuted the believers. He went from house to house in Jerusalem to arrest both men and women and to put them in prison. The high priest gave Saul permission to go to the city of Damascus to arrest Christians there and to bring them back to Jerusalem.

Insundun  Sauloy pangkap na sa mani manampalataya amen dakpen. Naku ya sa mani  binali bali,  pandakpen nay mani manampalataya,  liyaki man o babayi,  buy pan-isukul.   Nanyawad yapun  paintulut  sa pinakapuun parin mani Judiu amen  mangkap mani manampalataya sa Damascu. Dakpen nay mani manampalataya baydu buy ipasukul  sa Jerusalem.

While Saul was on his way to Damascus, a bright light from heaven shone all around him, and he fell to the ground. Saul heard someone say, "Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?" Saul asked, "Who are you, Master?" Jesus replied to him, "I am Jesus. You are persecuting me!"

Kaban papakun sila sa Damascu,  nagpakit si Jesus  kan Saulo.  Nakakit si Saulo  un mamakasilaw wa sawang. Sinabin Jesus kan Saulo, “Saulu! Saulu! Uysiyan  pand-usigin muku yata?”  Nakitbay si Saulu, “Sisabêt kan kayêk?”  Nakitbay si Jesus, “ Siku si Jesus, ya pan-usigin mu.”

When Saul got up, he could not see. His friends had to lead him into Damascus. Saul did not eat or drink anything for three days.

Sen  nideng si Saulu,   ayina makakit,  tinambay yatan  mani kaawyun na papakun sa Damascu.  Aya nangan o ninem sa lalen tatluy allu.

There was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. God said to him, "Go to the house where Saul is staying. Place your hands on him so that he can see again." But Ananias said, "Master, I have heard how this man has persecuted the believers." God answered him, "Go! I have chosen him to declare my name to the Jews and to people from other people groups. He will suffer many things for my name."

Pikisabyan naman Bapan Namalyari si Ananias.  Si si Ananias gisa yan manampalataya.  Sinabin Bapan Namalyari, “ Maku ka sa bali ya tutugelan Saulu. Ipaluntu  muy gamet mu kana amen makakit yan manguman.”  Nuwa nakitbay si  Ananias, “ Panginuun,   nabalitan kuy  pandakpen Sauluy mani manampalataya.”  Sinabin Bapan Namalyari, “ Pinili  ku ya  amen makilala kun  mani tawu.  Makadanas yan kasakitan sa panunul na kangku.”

So Ananias went to Saul, placed his hands on him, and said, "Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, sent me to you so that you can regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit." Saul immediately was able to see again, and Ananias baptized him. Then Saul ate some food and his strength returned.

Nanunul si  Ananias kan Bapan Namalyari.  Sen nakitan  na si Saulu,  sinabi na, “ Inpalaku wakun Jesus baydi.  Sabay siyay nakisabi kamu sa dan papakun sa Damascu.  Ipaluntu ku kamuy gamet  ku amen makakit kan manguman buy amen  matanggap muy  Ispiritun Bapan Namalyari.”Nakakit yabay si Saulo buy nagpabawtismu  ya et. Baydu yapun nakaekan.  Buy  nanguman pinumas-ey.

Right away, Saul began preaching to the Jews in Damascus, saying, "Jesus is the Son of God!" The Jews were amazed that the man who had tried to destroy the believers now also believed in Jesus! Saul reasoned with the Jews, proving that Jesus was the Messiah. 

Tambeng nangarl si Saulo sa mani tawu.  Sinabi na, “ Si Jesus ya Anak  Bapan Namalyari!”  Nakaupapas  sa mani tawu gawan na tawuy  kalabay mamatin mani manampalataya  nagin manampalatayay  na.  Nakisubakan et si Saulo sa kaatag mani Judiu.  Labay nan pagpapetgan  kallay si Jesus sabay ya Mamiligtas. Sinagilyan  et ta lagyu na un Pablu.

After many days, the Jews made a plan to kill Saul. They sent people to watch for him at the city gates in order to kill him. But Saul heard about the plan, and his friends helped him escape. One night they lowered him over the city wall in a basket. After Saul escaped from Damascus, he continued to preach about Jesus.

Inpalanun  mani  Judiuy  patin  si Saulo.  In-utus lay  dakun umnuy  mani tawu  amen  magbantay  sa mani pasbul  balayan  buy   apatan  si Pablu  amen patin.  Nuwa natandan Pabluy palanu la.  Sa sawup mani kaluguran na nitakas ya.  Gisay yabi,   indin yan mani kaluguran na sa   maragul la baesket buy intabuy ya sa lawasan  bakud balayan.  Nakatakas  si Pablu buy  insundu nay pangaral  na kan Jesus.

Saul went to Jerusalem to meet with the disciples, but they were afraid of him. Then a believer named Barnabas took Saul to the apostles and told them how Saul had preached boldly in Damascus. After that, the disciples accepted Saul.

Naku si  Pablu sa Jerusalem amen  makasabi  ya mani  pinunun manampalatayay miaawyun.   Sabitun nuna malimu sila kan Pablu.  Kay   sinawpan yan  Bernabe.   Inkwentun Bernabe kalla nu parasaantun nangaral si Pablu sa Damascu. Bayu la ya pun  tinanggap.

Some believers who fled from the persecution in Jerusalem went far away to the city of Antioch and preached about Jesus. Most of the people in Antioch were not Jews, but for the first time, very many of them also became believers. Barnabas and Saul went there to teach these new believers more about Jesus and to strengthen the church. It was at Antioch that believers in Jesus were first called "Christians." 

Ase nabuyutan, naku silan Pablu buy si Bernabe sa  balayan Antioquia. Nanggaral sila buy  pinapas-ey lay  panampalatayan mani manampalataya baydu.  Gisay allu, kaban manalangin buy mag-ayunuy mani manampalataya sa  Antioquia, sinabin Ispiritun Bpan Namalyari kalla,”Italaga yu si  Pablu buy si Bernabe kangku. Dilag gakun ipadyag kalla.”

One day, while the Christians at Antioch were fasting and praying, the Holy Spirit said to them, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul to do the work I have called them to do." So the church in Antioch prayed for Barnabas and Saul and placed their hands on them. Then they sent them out to preach the good news about Jesus in many other places. Barnabas and Saul taught people from different people groups, and many people believed in Jesus.

Kabay nanalangin na mani manampalataya par kalla. Impaluntu la et ta gamet la kallan Pablu buy kan Bernabe. In-utus lay luwa amen  iaral la  Manged da Balita tungkul kan Jesus sa kaatag. Naku sila sa magmikakanayun na lugal buy nangaral.  Gawan  kallan Pablu buy  kan  Bernabe malakey nanampalataya kan Jesus.
