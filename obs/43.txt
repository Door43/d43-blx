After Jesus returned to heaven, the disciples stayed in Jerusalem as Jesus had commanded them to do. The believers there constantly gathered together to pray.

Sên nakapag-udung nga si Jesus sa langit, nanugêl pun sa Jerusalem ma mani tagasunul na. Abiin na sinabin  Jesus kalla. Pawa silan miaawyun buy manalangin.

Every year, 50 days after the Passover, the Jews celebrated an important day called Pentecost. Pentecost was a time when the Jews celebrated the harvest. Jews came from all over the world to Jerusalem to celebrate Pentecost together. This year, the time for Pentecost came about a week after Jesus had gone back to heaven.

Pamakalibas limampuy allu paubat sabitun nanguman nabyay si Jesus, inlumatêng nga pestan mani Judiu ya pambêgên Pestecostes. Gisay pestan pagpasalamat ta ati. Si kaganawan Judiu sa babun luta mamaku sa Jerusalem amên miaawyun magkalutu sa pesta.

While the believers were all together, suddenly the house where they were was filled with a sound like a strong wind. Then something that looked like flames of fire appeared over the heads of all the believers. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and they began to speak in other languages.

Gisay allu, miaawyun na mani tagasunul Jesus, mamakun ni nakalêngê silan sênêg sa buun bali ya pagtipunan  la. Ya sênêg ga ati ubat sa langit ya nanuwad malakas sa angin. Dilag silan nakit ta paran apuy ya nanuwad dila ya nag-ugpa sa balang gisa kalla. Pamakayari, natupus silan Ispiritun Bapan Namalyari. Bêngat ta silan nakapagsabin magmikakanayun na sabi.

When the people in Jerusalem heard the noise, a crowd came to see what was happening. When the people heard the believers proclaiming the wonderful works of God, they were astonished that they were hearing these things in their own native languages.

Sên nalêngên idi baydu sa Jerusalem ya magsabi silan magmikakanayun na sabi, nititipun na mani tawu. Labay lan matandan nu sabêt ta malalyari. Nakaupapas sila sên nalêngê lay mani tagasunul ya magsabi sa sabi la. Nalêngê lay pansabin mani tagasunul nu sabêt ta mangangêd da bagay ya dinyag Bapan Namalyari.

Some of the people accused the disciples of being drunk. But Peter stood up and said to them, "Listen to me! These people are not drunk! This fulfills the prophecy made by the prophet Joel in which God said, 'In the last days, I will pour out my Spirit.'"

Dilag dakun umnu bayduy nagsabin, “Kay malasing nga mani tawun abiin!” Nuwa nidêng si Pedru buy nagsabi, “Mallêngê kaw kangku! Asê malasing nga mani tawun ati nun a, natupad amêsên na sinabin Propeta Joel, 'Sa tawlin mani allu, idin kuy Ispiritu ku.'”

"Men of Israel, Jesus was a man who did many mighty signs and wonders by the power of God, as you have seen and already know. But you crucified him!"

“Mani kabalayan, si Jesus nanyag yan malakêy imala gawan sa kapangyarian Bapan Namalyari. Tanda kuy nakitan yu buy tanda yuy abitu. Impapaku yu ya pun êt bay sa krus!”

"Although Jesus died, God raised him from the dead. This fulfills the prophecy which says, 'You will not let your Holy One rot in the grave.' We are witnesses to the fact that God raised Jesus to life again."

“Nuwa pinabyay yan manguman un Bapan Namalyari. Kabay natupad kanay pansabin sa kasulatan, 'A mu paulayan  bumata sa pamilbêngan na Pinili mu.' Inuman pinabyay Bapan Namalyari si Jesus. Sikay mismuy nakakit ati.”

"Jesus is now exalted to the right hand of God the Father. And Jesus has sent the Holy Spirit just as he promised he would do. The Holy Spirit is causing the things that you are now seeing and hearing."

“Si Jesus nakaiknu yina amêsên sa êtêb Bapa tamun Namalyari. Impagtan Bapay impangaku na ya sabay ya  Ispiritun Bapan Namalyari. Ya mangaakit buy mangalêngê yu amêsên sabay ya ati ya pagpapêtêg ga natupad day  pangakun Bapan Namalyari.”

"You crucified this man, Jesus. But know for certain that God has caused Jesus to become both Lord and Messiah!"

“Sêpat yun mapukatan ya si Jesus ya impaku yu sa krus sabay ya Panginuun buy Mamiligtas!”

The people listening to Peter were deeply moved by the things that he said. So they asked Peter and the disciples, "Brothers, what should we do?"

Namatang kan Pedruy mani tawuy nakalêngê kana, “Mani mapatêl, sabêt ta sêpat yan daygên?”

Peter answered them, "Every one of you should repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so that God will forgive your sins. Then he will also give you the gift of the Holy Spirit."

Nakitbay si Pedru, “Magsisi kaw buy magpabawtismu sa lagyun Jesu Cristu amên patawarên na mani kasalanan yu. Bayu yu matanggap pa Ispiritun Bapan Namalyari.”

About 3,000 people believed what Peter said and became disciples of Jesus. They were baptized and became part of the church at Jerusalem. 

Malakêy naniwala sa sinabin Pedru. Kabay nagpabawtismu sila. Sa allu êt ta abaytu, tatluy libuy tawuy nidagdag sa mani manampalataya kan Jesus. Sabay silay nag-umpisa sa mani manampalatayay miaawyun. Asê nabuyutan, binêg silan Cristiyanu.

The disciples continually listened to the teaching of the apostles, spent time together, ate together, and prayed with each other. They enjoyed praising God together and they shared everything they had with each other. Everyone thought well of them. Every day, more people became believers.

Ya mani bayun nanampalataya kan Jesus, pawa silan mamaku sa mani apostul amên mallêngê sa mani pan-ituru la, pawa silan miaawyun bilang mipapatêl sa panampalataya, pawa sila êt miaawyun mangan tinapay bilang pangganaka la sa dinyag Jesus, buy pawa silan manalangin.
