====== 47. Paul and Silas in Philippi ======


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-47-01.jpg}}


As Saul traveled throughout the Roman Empire, he began to use his Roman name, "Paul." One day, Paul and his friend Silas went to the town of Philippi to proclaim the good news about Jesus. They went to a place by the river outside the city where people gathered to pray. There they met a woman named Lydia who was a merchant. She loved and worshiped God.

Pamakalibas dakun umnuy tawun, pikilakun  Pablu si Silas ya kaluguran na papakun sa  Filipus. In-aral la  bayduy  Manged da Balita tungkul kan Jesus. Nagin kaluguran la et si  Lydia.  Si si Lydia magtinda yan telay  batek muradu. Kakaidwan buy  pan-ulimenen na si  Bapan Namalyari.

God opened Lydia's heart to believe the message about Jesus, and she and her family were baptized. She invited Paul and Silas to stay at her house, so they stayed with her and her family.

Sen napukatan  Lydiay  mensayi tungkul kan Jesus, nagpabawtismu ya buy  buun pamilya na. Sinagyat na  et silan Pablu buy si Silas sa  bali na.

Paul and Silas often met with people at the place of prayer. Every day as they walked there, a slave girl possessed by a demon followed them. By means of this demon she predicted the future for people, so she made a lot of money for her masters as a fortuneteller.

Pawan mamaku silan Pablu buy si Silas sa  lugal la  panalanginan sa  Filipus. Allu-allu, makitan la  bayduy  gisay ipus sa  anak ka babayi.  Pansedakan yan  nadawak ka ispiritu. Dilag yan  kabiyasnan manuga. Kabay maragul la panakitan amung na.

The slave girl kept yelling as they walked, "These men are servants of the Most High God. They are telling you the way to be saved!" She did this so often that Paul became annoyed.

Nu makitan na si Pablu buy si  Silas,  pakilalakwan na sila buy masneg nan pa-iangaw wa,  “Si mani tawun ati, lingkud silan Bapan Namalyari ya Katatag-ayan! Pan-iaral la kamuyu nu parasaantu kaw iligtas Bapan Namalyari!”

Finally one day when the slave girl started yelling, Paul turned to her and said to the demon that was in her, "In the name of Jesus, come out of her." Right away the demon left her.

Gisay allu, nagsuluk ka si Pablu kana sa kakaangaw na. Intabi nay nadawak ka ispiritu sa lawinin anak, “Sa lagyun  Jesus, magtas ka sa lawinin anak!” Sa uras et ta abitu, inlakwanan un  nadawak ka ispirituy anak.

The men who owned the slave girl became very angry! They realized that without the demon, the slave girl could not tell people the future. This meant that people would no longer pay her owners money so that she would tell them what would happen to them.

Natubag tubag ga amung anak gawan  ayin ninan panakitan. Asina makapanugay anak ka ipus.

So the owners of the slave girl took Paul and Silas to the Roman authorities, who beat them and threw them into jail.

Kabay impadakep na silan  Pablu buy si Silas. Dinuge lay luwa  bayu la insukul sa sukulan.

They put Paul and Silas in the most secure part of the prison and even locked up their feet. Yet in the middle of the night, they were singing songs of praise to God.

Indin silan  Pablu sa nalalêlalêy sukulan. Binyanan et kayuy  bitis la amen  a sila mibita. Nuwa pamakayabi,  ya sepat dayin malungkut sila, nagkanta silan pangulimen kan Bapan Namalyari.

Suddenly, there was a violent earthquake! All the prison doors flew open, and the chains of all the prisoners fell off.

Bengat tan naeyeg ga luta. Nibuklat ta  mani  pasbul sukulan. Naaswag ga kaganawan kadenan mani  nakasukul.

The jailer woke up, and when he saw that the prison doors were open, he was terrified! He thought all the prisoners had escaped, so he planned to kill himself. (He knew the Roman authorities would kill him if he allowed the prisoners to escape.) But Paul saw him and yelled, "Stop! Do not hurt yourself. We are all here."

Sen nakitan  magbantay ya nibuklat ta  mani  pasbul sukulan, magpakamati yina dayi gawan indap na nu  nitakas say mani nakasukul. (Gawan nu nalyari ya abitu, patin ya et mani pinunu na.) Nuwa nakitan yan Pablu. Kabay sinabi na, “Agana mu panasakitan na sarili mu. Abiti kay kaganawan!”

The jailer trembled as he came to Paul and Silas and asked, "What must I do to be saved?" Paul answered, "Believe in Jesus, the Master, and you and your family will be saved." Then the jailer took Paul and Silas into his home and washed their wounds. Paul preached the good news about Jesus to everyone in his house.

Nalimuy magbantay sa sukulan. Pikilaku na silan Pablu buy si Silas sa bali na. Pinakan nay luwa buy  inuyasan nay mani nuka la. Bayu ya  namatang, “Sabet ta sepat kun daygen  amen miligtas saku?”

The jailer and his whole family believed in Jesus and were baptized. Then the jailer gave Paul and Silas a meal and they rejoiced together.

Sinabin Pablu, “Manampalataya ka sa Panginuun Jesus amên miligtas ka buy pamilya mu.” Pamakayari binawtismuwan  Pabluy magbantay sa sukulan buy buun pamilya na.  Buy niaawyun silan nagsaya.

The next day the leaders of the city released Paul and Silas from prison and asked them to leave Philippi. Paul and Silas visited Lydia and some other friends and then left the city. The good news about Jesus kept spreading, and the Church kept growing.

Kinawasakan, imbus san mani pinunun balayan  silan Pablu buy si Silas. Pikisabyan lay luway mitay na sa  Filipus. Bayu sila  namita,  naku sila pun kan  Lydia buy  sa mani kaluguran la. Kapanlulumaken  manampalataya sa  Manged da Balita tungkul kan  Jesus. Kapanlulumake et  manampalatayay miaawyun.

Paul and other Christian leaders traveled to many cities, preaching and teaching people the good news about Jesus. They also wrote many letters to encourage and teach the believers in the churches. Some of these letters became books of the Bible.

Nangaral  si Pablu buy kaatag pun na  mamunu sa manampalataya sa magmikakanayun na lugal. Pan-iaral lay tungkul kan  Jesus.  Nanulat sila et  sa  mani  manampalatayay miaawyun. Pinapas-ey lay nakem mani manampalataya. Impapukat la et  ya tungkul sa Bayuy Kasunduan ya dinyag Bapan Namalyari para sa mani manampalatayay miaawyun.
