One day, Peter asked Jesus, "Master, how many times should I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?" Jesus said, "Not seven times, but seventy times seven!" By this, Jesus meant that we should always forgive. Then Jesus told this story.

Gisay allu, namatang  si Pedru kan Jesus, “Panginuun, kati-umnu kun patawarên na patêl kuy pawan manyag kasalanan kangku? Makatapitu nayi?”
Nakitbay  kana si Jesus, “Alwan kay pitu nun a pitumpu buy pitu.” Ya labay sabin Jesus, pawa yan mamatawad. Nagkwentu si Jesus.

Jesus said, "The kingdom of God is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. One of his servants owed a huge debt worth 200,000 years' wages."

Paradi ya pag-arin Bapan Namalyari, maiparisu sa pag-arin gisay ari ya nipabêg sa mani ipus na amên singilin sa mani utang la. Dilag gisay ipus ya nakautang milyun-milyun kana.

"Since the servant could not pay the debt, the king said, 'Sell this man and his family as slaves to make payment on his debt.'"

“Gawan a ya makabayad, sinabin ari, ‘Isaliw yu silan mipapamilya, buy kaganawan pibandiyan la amên mabayaran nay utang na kangku.’ ”

"The servant fell on his knees before the king and said, 'Please be patient with me, and I will pay the full amount that I owe you.' The king felt pity for the servant, so he canceled all of his debt and let him go."

“Kabay nakilunus-lunus buy nandukuy ipus sa ari, ‘Ari kuway biyan mu ku pun kayêk panawun, amên mabayaran kuy kaganawan utang ku.’ Kinalunusan yan ari buy a nayna impabayad da utang na.

"But when the servant went out from the king, he found a fellow servant who owed him a debt worth four months' wages. The servant grabbed his fellow servant and said, 'Pay me the money that you owe me!'"

“Nuwa pamakabitan ipus, natbêng nay gisay kaparisu nan ipus ya nakautang pêrad kana. Dinagus naya buy ginêyêk, sinabi na, “Bayaran muy utang mu kangku!”

"The fellow servant fell on his knees and said, 'Please be patient with me, and I will pay the full amount that I owe you.' But instead, the servant threw his fellow servant into prison until he could pay the debt."

“Nanduku kanay kaparisu nan ipus buy nakilunus-lunus, ‘Biyan muku pun kayêk panawun amên mabayaran kuy kaganawan nautang ku kamu.’ Nuwa a ya nakalabay nun a, impasukul nay kaparisu nan ipus anggan a ya pun makabayad.”

"Some other servants saw what had happened and were greatly disturbed. They went to the king and told him everything."

“Dilag dakun umnuy ipus sa nakakit sa dinyag na, nalungkut sila. Kabay naku sila sa ari amên ipatanda lay kaganawan nalyari.”

"The king called the servant and said, 'You wicked servant! I forgave your debt because you begged me. You should have done the same.' The king was so angry that he threw the wicked servant into prison until he could pay back all of his debt."

“Impabêg amêsên ari ya ipus buy sinabi kana, ‘Ipus asê mangêd da nakêm mu! A ku inpabayad da nautang mu gawan nakilunus-lunus ka kangku. Siyan a ka ya nalunus sa kaparisu mun ipus kaparisun pallunus ku kamu?’ Gawan sa tubag ari, impasukul nay ase manged da ipus anggan a na pun mabayadan na kaganawan nautang na.”

Then Jesus said, "This is what my heavenly Father will do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart."

Pamakayari, sinabin Jesus, “Parabaysên êt ta daygên Bapa kuy idi sa langit, nu alwan buun nakêm ma pamatawad yu sa kaparisu yu.”
