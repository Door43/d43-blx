Mary was engaged to a righteous man named Joseph. When he heard that Mary was pregnant, he knew it was not his baby. He did not want to shame Mary, so he planned to quietly divorce her. Before he could do that, an angel came and spoke to him in a dream.

Si si Jose, mangêd yan tawu. Sên natandan nay nabuktut si Maria, tanda nay alwa nan anak ka abitu. Nuwa a na labay mipakadeng-êy si Maria. Kabay pinagnakêm na tanay lakwanan nata si Maria un ayin magtanda. Nuwa a na pun nadyag ga palanu na, pinagkasabi yan ang-el Bapan Namalyari sa kapamilatan taynêp.

The angel said, "Joseph, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. The baby that is in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son. Name him Jesus (which means, 'Yahweh saves'), because he will save the people from their sins."

Sinabin ang-el kana, “Agana ka malimuy Jose ya tangenen si Maria. Ta si pan-ibuktut na ubat sa Ispiritun Bapan Namalyari. Liyaki ya ianak na. Buy si ipalagyu mu kana, Jesus ta sabay siyay mamiligtas un mani tawu sa mani kasalanan la.”

So Joseph married Mary and took her home as his wife, but he did not sleep with her until she had given birth.

Kabay tinangên Jose si Maria. Nuwa a naya tinakês kinimit anggan asê pun in-anak Mariay kulaw.

When the time was near for Mary to give birth, the Roman government told everyone to go for a census to the town where their ancestors had lived. Joseph and Mary had to make a long journey from where they lived in Nazareth to Bethlehem because their ancestor was David whose hometown was Bethlehem.

Sabitun marani yan manganak si Maria. In-utus gubernun Roma ya magpasensus ya kaganawan pansakupen la nu saantu sila in-anak. Kabay agyan marayu napilit namitan naku sa Betlehem silan Jose buy si Maria amên magpasensus ta in-anak baydu si Jose. In-anak êt baydu si Aring David.

When they arrived in Bethlehem, there was no place to stay. The only room they could find was a place where animals stayed. The baby was born there and his mother laid him in a feeding trough, since they did not have a bed for him. They named him Jesus.

Pamakalatêng la sa lugal Betlehem, ayin silan matugêlan. Si kay malyari lan mapagpaynawan kay abituy balin mani saysay. Buy baydu naynan in-anak ka kulaw. Inlampinan  Mariay kulaw buy impakalêk na sa pamakanan mani saysay, ta ayin silan makit ta mapagkalêkan. Jesus ya inpalagyu la sa kulaw.

That night, there were some shepherds in a nearby field guarding their flocks. Suddenly, a shining angel appeared to them, and they were terrified. The angel said, "Do not be afraid, because I have some good news for you. The Messiah, the Master, has been born in Bethlehem!"

Sa yabi êt abitu, dilag  magpastul tupa sa panggitnan ya manaysay mani hayop la. Mamakun ni nagpakit kallay gisay ang-el. Sadyay limu la. Nuwa sinabin ang-el, “Agana kaw malimu, ta dilag gakun mangêd da ibalita para kamuyu. In-anak kana sa Betlehem ya Mamiligtas ya sabay ya Panginuun.”

"Go search for the baby, and you will find him wrapped in pieces of cloth and lying in a feeding trough." Suddenly, the skies were filled with angels praising God, saying, "Glory to God in heaven and peace on earth to the people he favors!"

“Têkapên yu yabuy makit yu ya. Nakapunggus lampin na nakulaw buy nakakalêk ya sa pamakanan mani saysay.” Mamakun ni bêngat tan nagpakit ta sadyay lakên ang-el. Mangulimên sila kan Bapan Namalyari. Sinabi la, “Ulimênên si Bapan Namalyari ya idi sa langit. Buy dilag gan kapatêtbêkan ya mani tawuy idi sa babun luta ya kapapidu kana.”

The shepherds soon arrived at the place where Jesus was and they found him lying in a feeding trough, just as the angel had told them. They were very excited. Mary was very happy, too. The shepherds returned to the fields where their sheep were, praising God for all they had heard and seen.

Sên inlumatêng nga mani magpastul nu saantu in-anak si Jesus, nakit lay kulaw wa nakakalêk sa pamakanan mani saysay ayun sa sinabin ang-el kalla. Sadyay saya la sa mani nalêngê buy nakitan la. Kaban mag-udung silay na sa mani saysay lay tupa, inulimên la si Bapan Namalyari.

Sometime later, wise men from countries far to the east saw an unusual star in the sky. They realized it meant a new king of the Jews had been born. So, they traveled a great distance to see this king. They came to Bethlehem and found the house where Jesus and his parents were staying.

Pamakalibas dakun umnuy panawun, dilag gaman inlumatêng  sa Jerusalem ya mangabiyasay tawu. Gawan dilag silan nakit  sa langit ya ayin kaparisuy bêtêwên, tanda lay labay sabin ya dilag in-anak ka kulaw ya sabay ya bayuy arin mani Judiu.

When the wise men saw Jesus with his mother, they bowed down and worshiped him. They gave Jesus expensive gifts. Then they returned home.

Sên nakitan la si Jesus ya aampun indu na, nanduku sila buy inulimên lay kulaw. Binyanan la ya êt maulagay degalu si Jesus. Pamakayari nuli silayna.
