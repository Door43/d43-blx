Mary was engaged to a righteous man named Joseph. When he heard that Mary was pregnant, he knew it was not his baby. He did not want to shame Mary, so he planned to quietly divorce her. Before he could do that, an angel came and spoke to him in a dream.

Si si Jose  manged yan tawu. Sen natandan nay nabuktut si Maria,  tanda  nay  alwa nan anak ka abitu. Nuwa a na labay mipakadeng-ey si Maria,  Kabay pinagnakêm na tanay  lakwanan nata si Maria un ayin magtanda.  Nuwa   a na pun nadyag ga palanu na, pinagkasabi yan ang-el Bapan  Namalyari sa  kapamilatan  taynep.

The angel said, "Joseph, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. The baby that is in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son. Name him Jesus (which means, 'Yahweh saves'), because he will save the people from their sins."

Sinabin ang-el kana, << Agana ka malimuy Jose ya tangenen si Maria.  Ta si  pan-ibuktut na ubat sa Ispiritun Bapan Namalyari.  Liyaki ya ianak na.  Buy si ipalagyu mu kana Jesus ta sabay siyay mamiligtas un  mani tawu  sa mani kasalanan la.>>

So Joseph married Mary and took her home as his wife, but he did not sleep with her until she had given birth.

Kabay tinangen Jose si Maria.  Nuwa a naya tinakes kinimit anggan ase pun in-anak Mariay kulaw.

When the time was near for Mary to give birth, the Roman government told everyone to go for a census to the town where their ancestors had lived. Joseph and Mary had to make a long journey from where they lived in Nazareth to Bethlehem because their ancestor was David whose hometown was Bethlehem.

Sabitun marani yan  manganak si Maria. In-utus gubernun  Roma ya magpasensus ya kaganawan pansakupen la nu  saantu sila in-anak.  Kabay   agyan marayu napilit  namitan naku  sa Betlehem silan Jose buy si  Maria, amen magpasensus  ta in-anak baydu si Jose. In-anak et baydu si Aring David.

When they arrived in Bethlehem, there was no place to stay. The only room they could find was a place where animals stayed. The baby was born there and his mother laid him in a feeding trough, since they did not have a bed for him. They named him Jesus.

Pamakalateng la  sa lugal Betlehem,  ayin silan matugelan.  Si kay malyari lan mapagpaynawan kay abituy balin mani saysay.  Buy baydu naynan in-anak ka kulaw,  inlampinan  Mariay kulaw  buy impakalek na sa pamakanan mani saysay,  ta ayin silan makit ta  mapagkalekan.  Jesus ya inpalagyu la sa kulaw.

That night, there were some shepherds in a nearby field guarding their flocks. Suddenly, a shining angel appeared to them, and they were terrified. The angel said, "Do not be afraid, because I have some good news for you. The Messiah, the Master, has been born in Bethlehem!"

Sa yabi et abitu,  dilag  magpastul tupa sa panggitnan ya manaysay mani hayop la.  Mamakun ni   nagpakit kallay gisay ang-el.  Sadyay limu la.  Nuwa sinabin ang-el, << Agana kaw malimu,   ta dilag gakun manged da ibalita para kamuyu.  In-anak kana sa Betlehem ya Mamiligtas ya sabay ya Panginuun.

"Go search for the baby, and you will find him wrapped in pieces of cloth and lying in a feeding trough." Suddenly, the skies were filled with angels praising God, saying, "Glory to God in heaven and peace on earth to the people he favors!"

<<Tekapen yu ya buy makit yu ya. Nakapunggus  lampin na  nakulaw buy  nakakalek  ya sa pamakanan mani saysay. >> Mamakun ni bengat tan nagpakit ta sadyay laken ang-el. Mangulimen sila kan Bapan Namalyari.  Sinabi la,<<Ulimenen si Bapan Namalyari ya idi sa langit. Buy dilag gan kapatêtbêkan ya mani tawuy  idi sa babun luta ya kapapidu kana.>>

The shepherds soon arrived at the place where Jesus was and they found him lying in a feeding trough, just as the angel had told them. They were very excited. Mary was very happy, too. The shepherds returned to the fields where their sheep were, praising God for all they had heard and seen.

Sen inlumateng nga mani magpastul nu saantu in-anak si Jesus, nakit lay kulaw wa nakakalek sa pamakanan mani saysay ayun sa sinabin ang-el kalla.  Sadyay saya la  sa mani nalenge buy nakitan la.  Inulimen la si Bapan Namalyari kaban   mag-udung silay na sa mani saysay lay  tupa.

Sometime later, wise men from countries far to the east saw an unusual star in the sky. They realized it meant a new king of the Jews had been born. So, they traveled a great distance to see this king. They came to Bethlehem and found the house where Jesus and his parents were staying.

Pamakalibas dakun umnuy panawun, dilag gaman inlumateng  sa Jerusalem ya  mangabiyasay tawu. Gawan  dilag silan nakit  sa langit ya ayin kaparisuy betewen.  Tanda lay  labay sabin  ya dilag  in-anak ka kulaw ya sabay  ya bayuy arin mani Judiu

When the wise men saw Jesus with his mother, they bowed down and worshiped him. They gave Jesus expensive gifts. Then they returned home.

Sen nakitan la si Jesus ya aampun indu na, nanduku sila buy inulimen lay kulaw.  Binyanan laya  et maulagay degalu si Jesus.  Pamakayari nuli silayna.

//A Bible story from: Matthew 1; Luke 2//
