An angel told a virgin named Mary that she would give birth to God's Son. So while she was still a virgin, she gave birth to a son and named him Jesus. Therefore, Jesus is both God and human.

Dalaga pun si Maria sabitun in-anak na si Jesus, gawan  Anak  Bapan Namalyari si Jesus. Si Jesus  Namalyari ya buy  tawu ya.

Jesus did many miracles that prove he is God. He walked on water, calmed storms, healed many sick people, drove out demons, raised the dead to life, and turned five loaves of bread and two small fish into enough food for over 5,000 people.

Malakey  mamakaupapas ya dinyag si Jesus ya magpapeteg ga  sabay siyay  Namalyari. Agyu nan mita sa babun lanem. Agyu nan  patgenen na bagyu. Mamaiyul ya et  nipagsakit, mamipatas nadawak ka ispiritu sa lawinin tawu, buy  pinabyay na et ta  mani nati.  Pinakan na et ta  maygit  limay libuy tawu sa kapamilatan kay lilimay tinapay buy  luway kenan lanem.

Jesus was also a great teacher, and he spoke with authority because he is the Son of God. He taught that you need to love other people the same way you love yourself.

Biyasa ya et  manuru. Pan-ituru nay sepat kaidwan tawuy kaparisdu na kaparisun pangidu na sa sarili na.

He also taught that you need to love God more than you love anything else, including your wealth.

Inturu na et ta  sepat  kaidwan mani tawu si Bapan Namalyari un igit sa kaganawan, agyan sa pibandiyan.

Sinabi et Jesus ya  mas maulagay miligtas ya tawu kaysa makwa nay kaganawan pibandiayan  baydi sa babun luta.

Jesus said that the kingdom of God is more valuable than anything else in the world. The most important thing for anyone is to belong to the kingdom of God. To enter into God's kingdom, you must be saved from your sin.

Inturu na et ya si kaganawan tawuy mangilala kana bilang Panginuun buy  Mamiligtas, miligtas ya.  Ya ase  mangilala kana  mipakabili ya sa impernu sa katganan babun luta.

Jesus taught that some people will receive him and be saved, but others will not. He said that some people are like good soil. They receive the good news of Jesus and are saved. Other people are like the hard soil of a path, where the seed of God's word does not enter and does not produce any harvest. Those people reject the message about Jesus and will not enter into his kingdom.

Nuwa inturun Jesus nu parasaantun kaidwan Bapan Namalyari ya  mani tawu agyan  makasalanan sila. Labay  Bapan Namalyarin  patawaren na sila amen magin anak nay mani tawu.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-07.jpg}}


Jesus taught that God loves sinners very much. He wants to forgive them and to make them his children.

Kabay kaparisun  inturun  Jesus ya, gawan sa kasalanan  mani tawu, nipapaway mani tawu  kan Bapan Namalyari,nagin kapatin tawu si Bapan Namalyari. Gawan ase labay Bapan Namalyari ya  kasalanan. 

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-08.jpg}}


Jesus also told us that God hates sin. When Adam and Eve sinned, it affected all of their descendants. As a result, every person in the world sins and is separated from God. Therefore, everyone has become an enemy of God.

Nuwa kakaidwan  Bapan Namalyari ya  mani tawu kabay indin nay kagisagisay Anak na, sabay si Jesus. Ya kaganawan  manampalataya kan Jesus ase mipakabili sa  impernu. Nun a mabiyan biyay ya ayin katganan.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-09.jpg}}


But God loved everyone in the world so much that he gave his only Son so that whoever believes in Jesus will not be punished for his sins, but will live with God forever.

Gawan sa kasalanan mu, matanggap muy  kamatyan  buy tubag  Bapan Namalyari. Nuwa ya tubag  Bapan Namalyari kamu,  indin na kan Jesus. Nalyari ya abitu   sabitun nati si  Jesus sa krus. Baydu sa krus, tinanggap nay parusa sa mani kasalanan mu.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-10.jpg}}


Because of your sin, you are guilty and deserve to die. God should be angry with you, but he poured out his anger on Jesus instead of on you. When Jesus died on the cross, he received your punishment.

Si Jesus ya andug sa mani kasalanan mu. Ayin yan kasalanan kabay  nadyag nan  bayaran na  mani kasalanan mu, gawan kan  Jesus, napatawad day kaganawan  kasalanan mu.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-11.jpg}}


Jesus never sinned, but he chose to be punished and to die as the perfect sacrifice to take away your sins and the sins of every person in the world. Because Jesus sacrificed himself, God can forgive any sin, even terrible sins.

Amu mailigtas ya sarili mu sa  panyag  mun manged. Ayin kan madyag amen  maiudung muy pamikibetek mu kan Bapan Namalyari. Kay mitas ya kasalanan nu  yawaden muy linisin kan  Jesus buy manampalataya ka kana. Sepat kan  maniwala ya nati ya  para kamu buy nanguman  yan nabyay.

Good works cannot save you. There is nothing you can do to have a relationship with God. Only Jesus can wash away your sins. You must believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that he died on the cross instead of you, and that God raised him to life again.

Kaganawan mangilala kan Jesus bilang  Panginuun  miligtas ya. Ase maulaga nu  mabandi ka o kalulu ka, liyaki o babayi, tuwa o anak  buy nu  taga saantu ka. Kakaidwan  kan  Bapan Namalyari buy labay nan kilalanen  mu si Jesus amen magin  anak naka.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-13.jpg}}


God will save everyone who believes in Jesus and receives him as their Master. But he will not save anyone who does not believe in him. It does not matter if you are rich or poor, man or woman, old or young, or where you live. God loves you and wants you to believe in Jesus so he can have a close relationship with you.

Maniwala ka nayin  si Jesus ya  Mamiligtas, ya kagisa gisay Anak Bapan Namalyari? Maamin mu nayin makasalanan ka buy sepat parusan Bapan Namalyari? Maniwala ka nayin si Jesus ya  nananggap parusa ya sepat dayin sikay mananggap? Labay Jesus ya magdani ka kana, manampalataya ka kana buy magpabawtismu ka kana.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-14.jpg}}


Jesus invites you to believe in him and to be baptized. Do you believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the only Son of God? Do you believe that you are a sinner and that you deserve for God to punish you? Do you believe that Jesus died on the cross to take away your sins?

Nu paniwalan muy ati, gisa kay nan mampalataya! Intas kay nan  Bapan Namalyari sa  kadleman buy kan  Satanas. Indin kay nan  Bapan Namalyari  sa kaarian un nasawang. Ayin nay manan bagay, gawan   inbayuy nan Bapan Namalyari ya kaganawan.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-15.jpg}}


If you believe in Jesus and what he has done for you, you are a Christian! God has taken you out of Satan's kingdom of darkness and put you into God's kingdom of light. God has taken away your old, sinful ways of doing things and has given you new, righteous ways of doing things.

Nu manampalataya kay na,  pinatawad dan Bapan Namalyari yakaganawan kasalanan mu gawan sa pamibabatan Jesus. Kabay amesen, balang elewen kan Bapan Namalyari, alway nan kapati ya elew na kamu. Kaluguran nay elew na  amesen kamu.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-16.jpg}}


If you are a Christian, God has forgiven your sins because of what Jesus did. Now, God considers you to be a close friend instead of an enemy.

Buy bilang kaluguran Bapan Namalyari buy  lingkud Jesus ya Panginuun mu, sunulun mina amesen na  mani pan-iturun Jesus. Agyan manampalataya kay na, mapalyarin mangasalanan ka pun et. Nuwa pansabin  Bapan Namalyari nu pansabin muy kasalanan mu, tapat ta pamatawad na kamu buy biyan nakan pas-ey amen   malampusan muy kasalanan.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-17.jpg}}


If you are a friend of God and a servant of Jesus the Master, you will want to obey what Jesus teaches you. Even though you are a Christian, you will still be tempted to sin. But God is faithful and says that if you confess your sins, he will forgive you. He will give you strength to fight against sin.

Buy bilang kaluguran Bapan Namalyari buy  lingkud Jesus ya Panginuun mu, sunulun mina amesen na  mani pan-iturun Jesus. Agyan manampalataya kay na, mapalyarin mangasalanan ka pun et. Nuwa pansabin  Bapan Namalyari nu pansabin muy kasalanan mu, tapat ta pamatawad na kamu buy biyan nakan pas-ey amen   malampusan muy kasalanan.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-18.jpg}}


God tells you to pray, to study his word, to worship him with other Christians, and to tell others what he has done for you. All of these things help you to have a deeper relationship with him.

Pan-iutus kamun Bapan Namalyari  ya pawa kan manalangin,  mamasan  Sabi na buy  makiawyun sa pangulimen kaatag pun na mani anak na. Labay na et ya sabin mu sa kaatag ya mani pandaygen na kamu. Ya kaganawan ati makasawup kamu amen  pumas-ey  ya pamikibetek mu kan Bapan Namalyari.
