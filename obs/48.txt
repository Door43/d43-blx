When God created the world, everything was perfect. There was no sin. Adam and Eve loved each other, and they loved God. There was no sickness or death. This was the way God wanted the world to be.

Sabitun dinyag Bapan Namalyari  ya  babun luta,   kaganawan bagay   saktuy pangadiyag buy sabitun nuna ayin pun kasalanan.  Kaidwan lan Adan buy si Eba'y balang gisa buy  si Bapan Namalyari.  Sabitun nuna ayin pun kamatyan  buy  sakit.  Paradi ya labay Bapan Namalyarin malyari sa dinyag na.

Satan spoke through the snake in the garden in order to deceive Eve. Then she and Adam sinned against God. Because they sinned, everyone on earth gets sick and everyone dies.

Sa kapamilatan  utan pikisabyan  Satanas si Eba sa  hardin Eden amen tuksun. Kabay nangasalanan  si Adan buy  si Eba kan Bapan Namalyari.  Gawan  di,   nagin baagi yan  biyay kaganawan tawu sa babun lutay kamatyan,  sakit  buy  kasakitan.

Because Adam and Eve sinned, something even more terrible happened. They became enemies of God. As a result, every person since then has been born with a sinful nature and is also an enemy of God. The relationship between God and people was broken by sin. But God had a plan to restore that relationship.

Si nadawak pun et,  ya pamikibetek  tawu kan Bapan  Namalyari   nasira  et.  Kabay  si  kaganawan  pan-ianak amesen, tambeng ngan kapatin  Bapan Namalyari  gawan sa kasalanan.  Nuwa  dilag palanu si Bapan Namalyar amen  maiudung  sa manay kaganawan  siniran kasalanan.

God promised that one of Eve's descendants would crush Satan's head, and Satan would wound his heel. This meant that Satan would kill the Messiah, but God would raise him to life again, and then the Messiah will crush the power of Satan forever. Many years later, God revealed that Jesus is the Messiah.

Sabitun nuna impangakun Bapan Namalyari kan Eba'y gisa sa mani  kaapu-apuan nay  mallasaw sa ulun utan.  Nuwa  sugaten  naman Satanas sa  buwen ati.  Labay sabin,  mapatin Satanas si Jesus nuwa manguman yan mabyay sa ikatluy allu.  Gawan di, masiray  kaganawan kaagyuwan Satanas kanuman.

When God destroyed the whole earth by the flood, he provided the boat to save the people who believed in him. In the same way, everyone deserves to be destroyed because of their sins, but God provided Jesus to save everyone who believes in him.

Sabitun siniran  Bapan Namalyari ya babun luta sa kapamilatan maragul la  lanab, nagpadyag ya kan  Noe un gisay maragul la  barku. Ati ya  nagin paralan amen  miligtas silan  Noe  buy pamilya  na. Para et  bayduy dinyag  Bapan Namalyari. Agyan  na mani tawuy sepat mati gawan sa mani kasalanan la, nanyag  pun et  paralan si  Bapan Namalyari amen miligtas sa kaganawan manampalataya kan Jesus.

For hundreds of years, priests continually offered sacrifices to God for people to show the punishment that they deserved for their sins. But those sacrifices could not take away their sin. Jesus is the Great High Priest. Unlike other priests, he offered himself as the only sacrifice that could take away the sin of all the people in the world. Jesus was the perfect high priest because he took the punishment for every sin that anyone has ever committed.

Si pari ya si   Melquizedek pinagpala na si Abraham. Kaparisun Melquizedek, si  Jesus pari ya et,  nuwa sabay siyay pinakapuun pari. Miminsan yan nag-andug si in-andug na sabay ya sarili nan biyay. Kay biyay nan Jesus sa  makapitas kasalanan kaganawan tawu. Inakun Jesus  ya parusa para sa kasalanan  kaganawan tawu.

God told Abraham, "All the people groups of the earth will be blessed through you." Jesus was a descendant of Abraham. All the people groups are blessed through him, because everyone who believes in Jesus is saved from sin, and becomes a spiritual descendant of Abraham.

Sinabin Bapan Namalyari  kan  Abraham, “ Sa kapamilatan mu, pagplen kuy  kaganawan tawu sa  babun luta.” Si Jesus naubat ya  sa layin Abraham.  Buy  gawan kana, nakatanggap un pagpapalay  kaganawan tawuy  manampalataya kana. Sabay silay  nagin balayan  Bapan Namalyari,   layi silan Abraham sa ispiritwal.

When God told Abraham to offer his son, Isaac, as a sacrifice, God provided a lamb for the sacrifice instead of his son, Isaac. We all deserve to die for our sins! But God provided Jesus, the Lamb of God, as a sacrifice to die in our place.

Sabitun  iandug  dayin Abraham si  Isaac,  si Bapan Namalyari et ta nam-i un tupay iandug la. Nam-i et si Bapan Namalyarin  gisa pun et ta tupay in-andug para sa kaslanan kaganawan tawu. Sabay si  Jesus  ya tupn  abitu.  Sepat dayin  sikitamuy mati gawan sa kasalanan  tamu! Nuwa nam-i si Bapan Namalyarin andug ga kasagili tamu, sabay si  Jesus.

When God sent the last plague on Egypt, he told each Israelite family to kill a perfect lamb and spread its blood on the tops and sides of their door frames. When God saw the blood, he passed over their houses and did not kill their firstborn sons. This event is called the Passover.

Sabitun impagtan Bapan Namalyari ya tawlin pamasakit sa  Ehiptu, sinabin  na sa mani tawuy mangwa silan  biserun tupay liyaki. Patin lay ati buy punwan lan dayay mani pasbul bali la. Nu  makitan Bapan Namlyari ya daya, libasnan nay  balin abitu buy ana patin na panganay sa pamilyay nakatugel baydu. Si pameg di  Paskuwa.

Jesus is our Passover Lamb. He was perfect and sinless and was killed at the time of the Passover celebration. When anyone believes in Jesus, the blood of Jesus pays for that person's sin, and God's punishment passes over that person.

Si Jesus ya  Tupay Mamiligtas. Matinek ya buy ayin yan kasalanan. Pinati ya gisa sa allun Paskuwa.  Linisin Jesus  ya kasalanan agyan sisabet  man na  tawuy  manampalataya kana.  Libasnan yan parusan  Bapan Namalyari sa mani kasalanan na.

God made a covenant with the Israelites, who were his chosen people. But God has now made a New Covenant that is available to everyone. Because of this New Covenant, anyone from any people group can become part of God's people by believing in Jesus.

Nakikasundu si Bapan Namalyari sa mani taga Esrael kabay silay  nagin balayan Bapan Namalyari. Amesen naman, sa Bayuy Kasunduwan, miawyun  na mani tawuy pinilin Bapan Namalyari ya agyan sisabet man na tawuy manampalataya kan Jesus.

Moses was a great prophet who proclaimed the word of God. But Jesus is the greatest prophet of all. He is God, so everything he did and said were the actions and words of God. That is why Jesus is called the Word of God.

Si si Moises gisa yan dakilay propeta ya  mamipatandan  Sabin Bapan Namalyari. Si Jesus  propeta ya et  kaparisun  Moises, nuwa si Jesus alwa yan  kay dakilay propeta, sabya siyay  Sabin  Bapan Namalyari.

God promised King David that one of his descendants would rule as king over God’s people forever. Because Jesus is the Son of God and the Messiah, he is that special descendant of David who can rule forever.

Impangakun  Bapan Namalyari kan  David da maubat  sa layi nay  Mamiligtas sa lumateng.  Sabay si Jesus ya pantukuyun   Bapan Namalyari  sa pangakun ati.

David was the king of Israel, but Jesus is the king of the entire universe! He will come again and rule his kingdom with justice and peace, forever.

Si  Jesus  gisa yan ari kaparisun David, nuwa si Jesus ari ya sa kaganawan! Mag-udung ya buy mag-ari yan dilag katuynungan buy kapatetbekan kanuman.
