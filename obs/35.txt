One day, Jesus was teaching many tax collectors and other sinners who had gathered to hear him.

Gisay  allu,  panturwanan Jesus ya mani maningil buwis buy mani  tawuy makasalanan.

Some religious leaders who were also there saw Jesus treating these sinners as friends, and they began to criticize him to each other. So Jesus told them this story.

Sinabi pun êt Jesus ya alimbawa sa mani niaayas.

"There was a man who had two sons. The younger son told his father, 'Father, I want my inheritance now!' So the father divided his property between his two sons."

“Dilag gisay bapay nag-anak luway liyaki. Amesen sinabin  bunsu sa bapa na, ‘Bapay, idakay mina kangkuy atag ku sa mani pibandiyan mu.’ Kabay dinakay  yan  bapa lay dakay lan luwa.”

"Soon the younger son gathered all that he had and went far away and wasted his money in sinful living."

“Sen  nakwan bunsuy dakay na, naku ya sa  marayuy lugal.  Baydu na  ginastus sa pera na sa  ayin kapukatan na pamibiyay biyay na.

"After that, a severe famine happened in the land where the younger son was, and he had no money to buy food. So he took the only job he could find, feeding pigs. He was so miserable and hungry that he wanted to eat the pigs' food."

'Sa panawun  na abitu, inlumateng   nga sadyay layang  sa lugal la abitu.  Ayin nan peray bunsu kabay  ayin ninan  panaliw kanen.  Nakiipus yan mamakan babuy.  Sa sadyay kasakitan buy layang,  kanên nayna dayi ya pankanên babuy.”

"Finally, the younger son said to himself, 'What am I doing? All my father's servants have plenty to eat, and yet here I am starving. I will go back to my father and ask to be one of his servants.'"

“Sên naisip-isip nay kaganawan dinyag na, sinabi na sa nakêm nay, ‘Du kanyan naman nêy agyan na ipus bapa kuy ustuy pangkanên buy subra pun êt kalla. Nuwa sikina man, mati yan layangbaydi. Mag-udung ngaku sa bapa ku agyan magpaipus saku tana kana.”

"So the younger son started back towards his father's home. When he was still far away, his father saw him and felt compassion for him. He ran to his son and hugged him and kissed him."

Idi ya pun sa marayu, nakitan ninan bapa na. Sa lunus bapa na  kana, ginanagan nayan tinakês buy dinêp.”

"The son said, 'Father, I have sinned against God and against you. I am not worthy to be your son.'"

Sinabi na sa  bapa na, “Bapay nangasalanan naku kamu buy kan Bapan Namalyari.  A kina sêpat bêgên mun anak.”

"But his father told one of his servants, 'Go quickly and bring the best clothes and put them on my son! Put a ring on his finger and put sandals on his feet. Then kill the best calf so we can have a feast and celebrate, because my son was dead, but now he is alive! He was lost, but now he is found!'"

“Nuwa sinabin bapa na sa mani ipus na, ‘Parasên yu! Kêwên yuy pinakamangêd da yaming bayu yu ya payamingan. Pasingsingan yu  ya  buy pasapatusan yu ya. Buy mangwa kaw nabêlêng nga baka ya mataba taba. Patin yuy ati ta mangan kitamu buy magsaya! Gawan si anak kuy indap ku nu nati, pakan nabyay ya awêd! Indap ku êt nu nabating, pakan nakitan nana!’

"So the people began to celebrate. Before long, the older son came home from working in the field. He heard the music and dancing and wondered what was happening."

“Kabay nagsayay nay mani tawu.  Ase napeng  nuli ya  panganay ubat sa panggitnan.  Nalenge nay tigtigan buy talekan.  Inisip na  nu sabet ta  nalyari sa bali.”

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-35-11.jpg}}

"When the older son found out that they were celebrating because his brother had come home, he was very angry and would not go into the house. His father came out and begged him to come and celebrate with them, but he refused."

“Sen  natandan nay  si  kasayaan na  abitu, para sa pag-udung   bunsuy patel na,   nanubag ya.   A ya kalabay sumun sa lalen bali la. Kabay  nagsalwang nga bapa na buy  pikisabyan nayan makiawyun  ya sa kasayaan,  nuwa a ya nakalabay.” 


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-35-12.jpg}}

"The older son said to his father, 'All these years I have worked faithfully for you! I never disobeyed you, and still you did not even give me one small goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who consumed your money in sinful behavior came home, you killed the best calf for him!'"

Sinabin  panganay sa  Bapa na, ‘Bapay, sa makarang nga panawun, para kun ipus sa manunul sa kaganawan pan-iutus mu. Nuwa agyan minsan, a mukuta binyanan agyan kay gisay nabêlêng nga kambing ta amên makapagsaya ku kaawyun mani kaluguran ku. Nasên ata man na anak muy nangubus buy nanggastus san pibandiyan mu sa mani babayi ya pambayaran. Sên inlumatêng ya, siyan pinatyan  mu ya pun êt taman pinakamatabay baka ta!’ ” 

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-35-13.jpg}}

"The father answered, 'My son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But it is right for us to celebrate, because your brother was dead, but now is alive. He was lost, but now is found!'"

“Kabay nakitbay ya bapa na, ‘Pakan pawa kata yan kayêk pagkaawyun na anak kuta buy si kaganawan pibandiyan kuy, kay kamu. Nuwa  dapat kitamun magsaya  gawan si patêl muy indap tamu nu nati yana, pakan nabyay awêd. Indap tamu êt nu nabating ya, pakan nakitan tamu ya.’ ”
