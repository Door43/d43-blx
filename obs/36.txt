One day, Jesus took three of his disciples, Peter, James, and John with him. (The disciple named John was not the same person who baptized Jesus.) They went up on a high mountain by themselves to pray.

Gisay allu, pikilakun Jesus  ya tatluy  tagasunul na,   si Pedru,  buy  ya luway mipatel ya  si Santiagu buy si Juan. (Si Juan na pantukuyun baydi alwan si Juan na namawtismu kan  Jesus).  Kay kakapad lay sinumukpa sa matag-ay ya bung-uy amen manalangin.

As Jesus was praying, his face became as bright as the sun and his clothes became as white as light, whiter than anyone on earth could make them.

Kaban manalangin   si Jesus,  ya lupa na,  sinumawang nanuwad mamut buy ya yaming na, pinupumutin nanuwad sawang.

Then Moses and the prophet Elijah appeared. These men had lived on the earth hundreds of years before this. They talked with Jesus about his death, which would soon happen in Jerusalem.

Mamakun ni, nakitan lay makisabi si Moises buy si Elias kan Jesus.  Sabitun nabyay  sila baydi sa babun luta  nieteng silan tidinalan na tawun  lan nabyay  bayu  malyari ya ati.  Pisasabyan  lay tungkul  sa kamatyan Jesus ya marani yan  malyari sa  Jerusalem.

As Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus, Peter said to Jesus, "It is good for us to be here. Let us make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." Peter did not know what he was saying.

Kaban pakisabyan   Moises buy si Elias si Jesus,  sinabin Pedru kan Jesus, “Panginuun, mangêd da manugêl kay baydi. Nu labay mu, manyag gakun tatluy sawung: gisa kamu, gisa kan Moises buy gisa êt kan Elias.”  Sinabin Pedruy abiin gawan a na tanda nu  sabet ta pansabin na.

As Peter was talking, a bright cloud came down and surrounded them and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son whom I love. I am pleased with him. Listen to him." The three disciples were terrified and fell on the ground.

Kaban  magsabi pun si  Pedru,  natugpawan buy napalitengan  silan mamakasilew  wa  ulap.  Naubat sa ulap ya magsabin, “Ati ya kakaidwan kun Anak ya lubus kapapaidu kangku. Mallêngê kaw kana!”  . Gawan  sa limun mani tagasunul nipaglukub sila sa luta.

Then Jesus touched them and said, "Do not be afraid. Get up." When they looked around, the only one still there was Jesus.

Tinalan silan  Jesus  buy  sinabi na kalla, “Mideng kaw, gana  kaw malimu.”  Sen nangelew sila sa paliteng  la,  ayin silaynan nakitan  nun a kay si Jesus.

Jesus and the three disciples went back down the mountain. Then Jesus said to them, "Do not tell anyone yet about what happened here. I will soon die and then come back to life. After that, you may tell people."

Kaban mallumunsan  si Jesus buy   mani tagasunul na sa  bung-uy,  sinabin Jesus kallay, “Gana yu sabin agyan kan  sabêt man na nakitan yu anggan asê manguman mabyay ya Anak Tawuy ubat sa langit.  Nu nalyari yay sinabi ku  malyari  yinan ikuwentu.”
