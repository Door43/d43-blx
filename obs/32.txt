One day, Jesus and his disciples went in a boat across the lake to the region where the Gerasene people lived.

Gisay allu, naglipay si Jesus sa dagat un Galilea papakun sa lutan mani Gerasenu.

When they reached the other side of the lake, a demon-possessed man came running up to Jesus.

Sên nilatêng ya sa lipay dagat, timbêng yan gisay liyaki ya sinêdakan nadawak ka ispiritu.

This man was so strong that nobody could control him. People had even fastened his arms and legs with chains, but he kept breaking them.

Sadyay pas-êy liyaki. Kabay ayin makabênbên kana. Agyan kadena pun na pamis-êl kana, mabuytu na.

The man lived among the tombs in the area. This man would scream all day and all night. He did not wear clothes and cut himself repeatedly with stones.

Manugêl la liyakin ati sa pamilbêngan. Pawa yan man-angaw. A ya magyaming buy pansugaten nan batuy lawini na.

When the man came to Jesus, he fell on his knees in front of him. Jesus said to the demon, "Come out of this man!"

Kabay nuwayu yan nagdani kan Jesus buy nanduku ya sa arapan na. Sinabin Jesus sa nadawak ka ispiritu, “Mag-awas ka sa tawun abiin!”

The man with the demon cried out in a loud voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Please do not torture me!" Then Jesus asked the demon, "What is your name?" He replied, "My name is Legion, because we are many." (A "legion" was a group of several thousand soldiers in the Roman army.)

Kabay nan-angaw yan malakas, “Jesus ya anak Bapan Namalyari ya makapangyarian, sabêt ta daygên mu kangku? Makisabi yaku kamu, sa lagyun Bapan Namalyari, agana mu ku pasakitan.” 

Pinatang yan Jesus, “Sabet ta lagyu?” 

Nakitbay ya nadawak ka ispiritu, “Pulutung gawan malake kay.” (Ya pulutung  pan-ibuu un anem ma libuy sundalus).

The demons begged Jesus, "Please do not send us out of this region!" There was a herd of pigs feeding on a nearby hill. So, the demons begged Jesus, "Please send us into the pigs instead!" Jesus said, "Go!"

Nagpakalunus-lunus kan Jesus ya mani nadawak ka ispiritu, “Ipalaku mu kay sa mani babuy amên misun kay kalla.” Kabay tinulutan silan Jesus. 


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-08.jpg}}

The demons came out of the man and entered the pigs. The pigs ran down a steep bank into the lake and drowned. There were about 2,000 pigs in the herd.

Inumawas ya mani nadawak ka ispiritu sa liyaki. Sinumun sila sa 2,000 babuy buy nuwayun nagtabuy papakun sa pangpang bungaw. Kabay nangananabu sila sa dagat buy nangalulumud. 

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-09.jpg}}

When the people who took care of the pigs saw what happened, they ran into the town and told everyone that they met what Jesus had done. The people from the town came and saw the man who used to have the demons. He was sitting calmly, wearing clothes, and acting like a normal person.

Nuwayu ya mani manaysay un babuy buy inbalita la sa balayan buy sa kaatag pun lugal. Kabay naku bayduy mani tawu amên êlêwên la nu sabêt ta nalyari. Sên nagdani sila kan Jesus, nakitan lay liyaki ya ubatan nadawak ka ispiritu. Nakaiknuy na buy nagbaru yina buy mangêd day isip na.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-10.jpg}}

The people were very afraid and asked Jesus to leave. So Jesus got into the boat and prepared to leave. The man who used to have the demons begged to go along with Jesus.

Nuwa nalimwan mani tawu sa mani nadyag. Kabay pikisabyan la si Jesus amên lakwanan nay lugal abaytu. Kabay nagsakay si Jesus sa bangka. Nakisabi yaman na liyaki ya ubatan nadawak ka ispiritu, “Kilaku waku dayi kamuy, Jesus.” 


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-11.jpg}}

But Jesus said to him, "No, I want you to go home and tell your friends and family about everything that God has done for you and how he has had mercy on you."

Nuwa sinabin Jesus kana, “Muli ka sa mani kamag-anak mu amên maibalita mu kallay dinyag Panginuun kamu buy nu para nakasaantun kinalunusan.” 

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-12.jpg}}

So the man went away and told everyone about what Jesus had done for him. Everyone who heard his story was filled with wonder and amazement.

Kabay nuli ya liyaki. Inbalita nay dinyag un Jesus kana sa kaganawan kilala na. Buy nakaupapas ya kaganawan nakalêngên abitu.

Jesus returned to the other side of the lake. After he arrived there, a large crowd gathered around him and pressed in on him. In the crowd was a woman who had suffered from a bleeding problem for twelve years. She had paid all of her money to doctors so they would heal her, but she only got worse.

Nag-udung si Jesus sa lipay dagat. Malakêy tawuy nipipiitan kana. Dilag gisay babayi bayduy labinluway tawun nan pandayên. Naubus say kaganawan pibandiyan na sa pamayad sa pagpaêlêw na sa mani manulu. Nuwa asê mapaiyul, agyan sisabêt man na sakit na.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-14.jpg}}

She had heard that Jesus had healed many sick people and thought, "I'm sure that if I can just touch Jesus' clothes, then I will be healed, too!" So she came up behind Jesus and touched his clothes. As soon as she touched them, the bleeding stopped!

Nabalitan nay mamaiyul si Jesus. Kabay naku ya kan Jesus. Sên marani yina sa bukutan na, dinukpan nay palpal yaming Jesus. Pamakatalan na tambêng yan inumiyul.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-15.jpg}}

Immediately, Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. So he turned around and asked, "Who touched me?" The disciples replied, "There are many people crowding around you and bumping into you. Why did you ask, 'Who touched me?'"

Natanam Jesus ya dilag nag-awas sa kapangyarian ubat kana. Kabay nangêlêw ya sa palitêng buy namatang, “Sisabêt ta nandukpa kangkun ah?”  

Nakitbay ya mani tagasunul na, “Manuru, tanda muy malakêy tawuy nakapalitêng nga nipipiitan amên midani kamu. Uysiyan mamatang ka ya pun nu sisabêt ta nandukpa kamu ta?”

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-16.jpg}}

The woman fell on her knees before Jesus, shaking and very afraid. Then she told him what she had done, and that she had been healed. Jesus said to her, "Your faith has healed you. Go in peace."

Nandukuy babayi sa arapan  Jesus. Manginagin ya buy sadyay limu na. Insabi nay peteg. Kabay sinabin Jesus kana, “Patêl la, muli kaynan napatêtbêk ka nakêm. Inumiyul ka gawan sa panampalataya mu kangku.”
