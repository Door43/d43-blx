One day, an expert in the Jewish law came to Jesus to test him, saying, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus answered, "What is written in God's law?"

Gisay allu, dilag gisay manurun kautusan ya namatang kan Jesus ta labay nan subukan si Jesus. Sinabi na, “Manuru, sabêt ta sêpat kun daygên amên mabiyan nakun biyay ya ayin katganan?”  

Nakitbay si Jesus, “Sabêt ta nakasulat sa kautusan Bapan Namalyari?”

The law expert replied that God's law says, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind. And love your neighbor as yourself." Jesus answered, "You are correct! Do this and you will live."

Nakitbay ya manurun kautusan, “Kaidwan muy Panginuun mun Bapan Namalyari un buun bêkê, buun kaladwa, buun lakas, buy buun isip.” 

Sinabin Jesus kana, “Ustuy pikitbay mu,” Daygên muy abiin ta amên mabiyan kan biyay ya ayin katganan.”

But the law expert wanted to prove that he was righteous, so he asked, "Who is my neighbor?"

Nuwa asê labay manurun kautusan na mipakadêng-êy ya. Kabay pinatang na si Jesus, “Nu parabaydu sisabêt taman na kaparisu kun tawu?”

Jesus answered the law expert by telling a story. "There was a Jewish man who was traveling along the road from Jerusalem to Jericho."

Gisay kwentuy inpakitbay Jesus kana. “Dilag gisay liyaki ya mamita sa gisay dan ubat sa Jerusalem papakun Jerico.”

"While the man was traveling, he was attacked by a group of robbers. They took everything he had and beat him until he was almost dead. Then they went away."

Kaban mamita ya, inapat yan  mani tulisan. Kingwa lay kaganawan pibandiyan na. Dinugêdugê laya, buy inlakwanan lay nan paran nati.

"Soon after that, a Jewish priest happened to walk down that same road. When this religious leader saw the man who had been robbed and beaten, he moved to the other side of the road, ignored the man who needed help, and kept on going."

Amêsên, dilag pari un mani Judiu ya nidan baydu. Sên nakitan nay liyaki ya dinugêdugê, inlisyan naya. Buy insundu nay pamita na.

"Not long after that, a Levite came down the road. (Levites were a tribe of Jews who helped the priests at the Temple.) The Levite also crossed over to the other side of the road and ignored the man who had been robbed and beaten."

Dilag êt nidan bayduy gisay liyaki ya Levita ya ubat sa layin Levi. (Ya mani Levita gisay layin mani Judiu ya manawup sa mani pari ya maglingkud sa Templu). Buy sên inlumatêng ya baydu, nakitan nay gisay liyaki ya dinugêdugê, nuwa inlisyan naya êt.

"The next person to walk down that road was a Samaritan. (Samaritans were the descendants of Jews who had married people from other nations. Samaritans and Jews hated each other.) But when the Samaritan saw the Jewish man, he felt very strong compassion for him. So he cared for him and bandaged his wounds."

Amêsên, dilag gisay tawuy Samaritanuy nidan baydu. (Ya mani Samaritanu layi silan mani Judiuy nakapag-asawan kaatag  ga bansa. Milaban na mani Judiu buy mani Samaritanu). Nuwa sên nakitan nay liyaki ya dinugêdugê, kinalunusan naya.  Inuyasan nan alak buy laruy mani nuka na bayu na binêdbêdan.

"The Samaritan then lifted the man onto his own donkey and took him to a roadside inn where he took care of him."

“Insakay naya sa sarili nan asnu ya liyaki buy gintan sa gisay pan-ipaupay bali amên saysayên baydu.

"The next day, the Samaritan needed to continue his journey. He gave some money to the person in charge of the inn and said, 'Take care of him, and if you spend any more money than this, I will repay those expenses when I return.'"

“Pamakawasak, kaylangan isundun Samaritanuy pamita na.  Kabay binyanan nan peray magbandin bali ya pan-ipaupa. Sinabi na, “Saysayên mu ya buy nu kulang pun na abiin na magastus mu kana, bayaran kata sa pag-udung ku.”

Then Jesus asked the law expert, "What do you think? Which one of the three men was a neighbor to the man who was robbed and beaten?" He replied, "The one who was merciful to him." Jesus told him, "You go and do the same."

Amêsên, pinatang Jesus ya manurun kautusan, sinabi na, “Sa êlêw mu, sisabêt sa tatlun ati ya pêtêg ga nangidu sa kaparisu nan tawuy dinugêdugên mani tulisan?” 

Nakitbay ya manurun kautusan, “Sa êlêw kuy ya nalunus kana.” 

Kabay sinabin Jesus kana, “Dali ka. Para êt bayduy daygên mu.”

//A Bible story from: Luke 10:25-37//
