John, the son of Zechariah and Elizabeth, grew up and became a prophet. He lived in the wilderness, ate wild honey and locusts, and wore clothes made from camel hair.

Sen dinumagul  la si Juan, napakadyag yan  propeta.  Manugel ya sa bung-uy.  Si pangkanên na, durun buy pulut panilan. Ya yaming na dyag sa sabut kamelyu.

Many people came out to the wilderness to listen to John. He preached to them, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of God is near!"

Malakey tawuy mamaku  kan Juan  amen mallenge sa pansabin na.  Pawa nan pansabin na paradi, “Pagsisyan yu buy lakwanan yuy mani kasalanan yu tagawan marani yay pag-arin Bapan Namalyari.”

When people heard John's message, many of them repented from their sins, and John baptized them. Many religious leaders also came to be baptized by John, but they did not repent or confess their sins.

Sen nalenge lay  pansabin Juan, dilag dakun umnuy tawuy nagsisi buy nagpabawtismu.   Nuwa   ya mani  pinunu la ya sabay ya Saduseu buy Pariseu ya mamaku et  baydu a sila  nagsisi buy nagpabawtismu.

John said to the religious leaders, "You poisonous snakes! Repent and change your behavior. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire." John fulfilled what the prophets said, "See, I send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."

Kabay sinabin Juan kalla, “Sikaw wa nangadadawak buy mapagtalingkayu kaparisun utan! Sisabêt ta nagsabi kamuyun makatakas kaw sa parusan Bapan Namalyari ya lumatêng?

Some Jews asked John if he was the Messiah. John replied, "I am not the Messiah, but there is someone coming after me. He is so great that I am not even worthy to untie his sandals."

Pinatang dakun umnuy Judiu si Juan, “ Sika nayi  ya Mamiligtas sa lumateng?” Nakitbay si Juan, “Alwan sikuy Mamiligtas, nuwa dilag gisay lumatêng nga mas makapangyarian kangku. A ku sêpat magin ipus na buy  aku sepat mangaswag  seel isteping na.”

The next day, Jesus came to be baptized by John. When John saw him, he said, "Look! There is the Lamb of God who will take away the sin of the world."

Kinawasakan,  inlakun  Jesus si Juan amen magpabawtismu.  Sen nakitan Juan si Jesus sinabi na sa mani tawu, “Elewen yu. Abiti yay Tupan Bapan Namalyari ya sabay  ya  mamitas  kasalanan kaganawan tawu.”

John said to Jesus, "I am not worthy to baptize you. You should baptize me instead." But Jesus said, "You should baptize me, because it is the right thing to do." So John baptized him, even though Jesus had never sinned.

Sinabin Juan kan Jesus, “Alwan sikuy  sêpat mamawtismu kamu, sikay naman na sepat  mamawtismu  kangku.”

When Jesus came up out of the water after being baptized, the Spirit of God appeared in the form of a dove and came down and rested on him. At the same time, God's voice spoke from heaven, saying, "You are my Son whom I love, and I am very pleased with you."

Sên nabawtismuwan na si Jesus, nag-awas ya sa lanêm, bengat tan nawang-at ta langit buy nag-ugpa kanay Ispiritun Bapan Namalyari ya nanuwad gisay pati-pati.  Buy dilag gisay tunuy ya ubat sa langit ta nagsabin, “Ati ya anak kuy kakaidwan ku buy kapapaidu kangku.”

God had told John, "The Holy Spirit will come down and rest on someone you baptize. That person is the Son of God." There is only one God. But when John baptized Jesus, he heard God the Father speak, saw God the Son, who is Jesus, and he saw the Holy Spirit.

Bayu pun malyari  ya ati,  sinabi yan Bapan Namalyari kan Juan, “ Gisa sa mani bawtismuwan mu, magtabuy  kanay   Ispiritun  Bapan Namalyari. Sabay  siyay Anak Bapan Namalyari.” Gigisay Bapan Namalyari, nuwa dilag  yan tatluy pangatawu/  pameg kana,   ya  Bapa, ya Anak buy Banal la Ispiritu.
