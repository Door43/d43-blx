After the soldiers mocked Jesus, they led him away to crucify him. They made him carry the cross on which he would die.

Pamakayarin dinustak si Jesus, gintan yan mani sundalus amen ipaku ya sa krus. Impabakay la  kan Jesus  ya krus ya pipakwan kana.

The soldiers brought Jesus to a place called "the Skull" and nailed his hands and feet to the cross. But Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing." Pilate commanded that they write, "King of the Jews" on a sign and put it on the cross above Jesus' head.

Gintan mani  sundalus si Jesus sa  gisay lugal ya nu begen”Bungu”.Impaku la baydu si  Jesus. Nuwa kaban pan-ipaku laya, sinabin Jesus, “Bapa patawaren  mu sila ta a la tanday pandaygen la.” Dilag inpapaku si  Pilatu  sa ugtun ulun  Jesus.  Si nakasulat baydu” Ati ya   Harin mani Judiu”.

The soldiers gambled for Jesus' clothing. When they did this, they fulfilled a prophecy that said, "They divided my garments among them, and gambled for my clothing."

Nibabagutan na  mani sundalus amen matandan la nu sisabet ta  makakwan  yaming  Jesus. A la tanda kaban pandaygen lay ati natupad day  idi sa kasulatan, paradi ya nakasulat,”Gininit lay mani yaming ku buy  pinibabagutan lay yaming ku.”

Jesus was crucified between two robbers. One of them mocked Jesus, but the other said, "Do you have no fear of God? We are guilty, but this man is innocent." Then he said to Jesus, "Please remember me in your kingdom." Jesus answered him, "Today, you will be with me in Paradise."

Dilag et  kaawyun si  Jesus un luway impaku sa krus, si gisa idi sa eteb panabtab na  buy si gisa idi sa  udi na. Sinabin  idi sa udin  Jesus,”Uysiyan  a muya iligtas ya  sarili mu pati sikay ta?” Nuwa sinabyanan  yan gisa pun na manakaw, ”A ka nayi malimu kan  Bapan Namalyari? Makasalanan kitamu, nuwa siya ayin yan kasalanan.” Buy sinabi na kan Jesus, “Ganagen muku nu mag-ari kay na.” Nakitbay si Jesus, “Amesen  et pakilaku kata  sa Paraisu.”

The Jewish leaders and the other people in the crowd mocked Jesus. They said to him, "If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross and save yourself! Then we will believe you."

Dinustak et  mani pinunun  Judiu  buy mani tawu si Jesus. Sinabi la, “Nu taganan sikay Anak  Bapan Namalyari, magtabuy ka buy iligtas muy sarili mu. Nu  madyag muy abiin, maniwala kay kamu!”

Then the sky over the whole region became completely dark, even though it was the middle of the day. It stayed dark from noon until 3:00 in the afternoon.

Ugtuy mamut ta abitu, nuwa bengat tan  dinumiglem  sa paliteng la. Nabuyutan  tatluy  uras ya  nadiglen.

Then Jesus cried out, "It is finished! Father, I give my spirit into your hands." Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. When he died, there was an earthquake and the large curtain that separated the people from the presence of God in the Temple was torn in two, from the top to the bottom.

Sinabin Jesus, “Bapay  nayari kinay impadyag mu kangku! Pan-idin kina kamuy ispiritu ku.” Pamakayari nabuytuwan ninan inawanen. Tambeng nangayun buy si maragul la  kurtina  ya idi sa lalen  templu napiatag sa bunak  paubat  sa   babu angga sa aypa.

Through his death, Jesus opened a way for people to come to God. When the soldier guarding Jesus saw everything that had happened, he said, "Certainly, this man was innocent. He was the Son of God."

Gawan sa  pangamatin Jesus, imbuklat tan Bapan Namalyari ya dan amen  makadani yay  mani tawu  kana. Sen  nakitan na ati un  sundalus ya  mamantay kan Jesu nasabi nay, “Taganan ayin kasalanan na tawun  ati. Peteg  awed da  Anak yan Bapan Namalyari.”

Then Joseph and Nicodemus, two Jewish leaders who believed Jesus was the Messiah, asked Pilate for Jesus' body. They wrapped his body in cloth and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then they rolled a large stone in front of the tomb to block the opening.

Pamakayari, inyawad  Jose ya taga Arimatea buy si Nicodemo ya  bangkay Jesus kan pilatu. Impunggus lan telay pallebeng ya lawinin Jesus buy impasun sa leyang nga pamilbengan. Pamakayari, tinakpan lan maragul la  batuy pamilbengan.
