On the day that Jesus was raised from the dead, two of his disciples were going to a nearby town. As they walked, they talked about what had happened to Jesus. They had hoped that he was the Messiah, but then he was killed. Now the women said he was alive again. They did not know what to believe.

Sa allu êt abitu, luwa sa mani tagasunul Jesus naku sa gisay madani ya  baryu.  Kaban  mamita sila,  
pisasabyan lay pangamatin Jesus buy sinabin mani babayi ya nanguman nabyay si Jesus. Magmitalisay nakêm la nu taganan si Jesus yabay ya Mamiligtas.

Jesus approached them and started walking with them, but they did not recognize him. He asked what they were talking about, and they told him about all the remarkable things that had happened concerning Jesus during the previous few days. They thought they were talking to a visitor who did not know what had happened in Jerusalem.

Nakiagnan si Jesus sa pamita la, nuwa a la ya nakilala. Pinatang silan Jesus, “Sabêt ta pisasabyan yu?” Kabay inkwentu la kan Jesus ya kaganawan nalyari sa dakun umnuy allu. Inday la dayuan si Jesus buy ayin tanda tungkul sa nalyari.

Then Jesus explained to them what God's word said about the Messiah. He reminded them that the prophets said the Messiah would suffer and be killed, but would rise again on the third day. When they arrived at the town where the two men planned to stay, it was almost evening.

Inpaintindin Jesus kallay Sabin Bapan Namalyari sabay ya magsabin dilag lumatêng nga Mamiligtas. Magkasakit buy mati ya. Nuwa manguman yan mabyay sa ikatluy allu. Mamayabi yabi yana sên milatêng sila sa baryun Emaus.

The two men invited Jesus to stay with them, so he did. When they were ready to eat the evening meal, Jesus picked up a loaf of bread, thanked God for it, and then broke it. Suddenly, they recognized that he was Jesus. But at that moment, he disappeared from their sight.

Kabay sinagyat si Jesus un luwa amên kilaku kana. Nakilaku yabay si Jesus kalla. Bayu sila nangan, nangwan tinapay si Jesus buy inpasalamat kan Bapan Namalyari bayu indin kalla. Sa dinyag na baydu laya pun nakilala  ya sabay siya awêd si Jesus, nuwa bêngat yatan napanat.

The two men said to each other, "That was Jesus! That is why our hearts were burning when he explained God's word to us!" Immediately, they went back to Jerusalem. When they arrived, they told the disciples, "Jesus is alive! We have seen him!"

Nisabi ya luway liyaki, “Kabay awêd matanam tay paran mana tay nan kakilala kaban panpakisabyan na kita sa dan buy pan-isabi na kantay Kasulatan.” Namaras silan naku sa Jerusalem. Pamakalatêng la baydu, ingkwentu la sa  mani tagasunul ya nalyari, “Nabyay si Jesus! Nakitan yan ya!”

As the disciples were talking, Jesus suddenly appeared in the room with them and said, "Peace to you!" The disciples thought he was a ghost, but Jesus said, "Why are you afraid and doubting? Look at my hands and feet. Ghosts do not have bodies like I do." To prove that he was not a ghost, he asked for something to eat. They gave him a piece of cooked fish, and he ate it.

Tambeng nagpakit kalla si Jesus. Indap mani tagasunul anito ya. Kabay sinabin Jesus, “Mapakamuyuy kapatêtbêkan! Uysiyan malimu kaw yata buy magluway nakêm? Elêwên yuy gamêt buy bitis ku. Ayin lawini ya anito.” Buy amên pagpapêtgan na alwa yan anitu, nanyawad yan intêktêk ka kênan lanêm buy kinnan na ati.

Jesus said, "I told you that everything written about me in God's word must be fulfilled." Then he opened their minds so that they could understand God's word. He said, "It was written long ago that the Messiah would suffer, die, and rise from the dead on the third day."

Sinabin Jesus, “Sinabi kina kamuyuy kaganawan nakasulat sa kasulatan tungkul sa malyari kangku sa lumatêng nga panawun.” Pamakayari imbuklat Jesus ya isip mani tagasunul amên mapukatan lay nakasulat sa Kasulatan.” Sinabi na pun êt, “Ati ya nakasulat, ‘Si Cristu ya impangakun Bapan Namalyari, kaylangan yan mati. Nuwa sa ikatluy allu, manguman yan mabyay.”

"It was also written in the scriptures that my disciples will proclaim that everyone should repent in order to receive forgiveness for their sins. They will do this starting in Jerusalem, and then go to all people groups everywhere. You are witnesses of these things."

“Nakasulat êt ta paradi, ‘Sa lagyun Cristu, kaylangan iaral la tungkul sa pagsisi buy sa pamatawad kasalanan sa balang lugal paubat sa balayan Jerusalem. Sikaw wa magpapêtêg sa mani bagay ya ati’ ”

During the next forty days, Jesus appeared to his disciples many times. Once, he even appeared to more than 500 people at the same time! He proved to his disciples in many ways that he was alive, and he taught them about the kingdom of God.

Nagpakit pun si Jesus sa mani tagasunul na sa lalên apattapuy allu. Nagpakit ya êt sa maygit liman dalan na tawu. Pinagpapêtgan na sa mani tagasunul nay pêtêg yan nabyay sa magmikakanayun na paralan. Tinurwanan na êt   sila tungkul sa pag-arin Bapan Namalyari.

Jesus said to his disciples, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. So go, make disciples of all people groups by baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and by teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. Remember, I will be with you always."

Sa katatawliyan apattapuy allu, sinabin Jesus sa mani tagasunul na, “Indin na kangkuy kaganawan kapangyarian sa langit buy sa  luta.  Kabay lakwên yuy mani tawu buy daygên yu silan mani tagasunul ku. Bawtismuwan yu sila sa lagyun Bapa, Anak, buy sa Ispiritu. Turwanan yu silan manunul sa mani in-utus ku kamuyu.”

Forty days after Jesus rose from the dead, he told his disciples, "Stay in Jerusalem until my Father gives you power when the Holy Spirit comes on you." Then Jesus went up to heaven, and a cloud hid him from their sight. Jesus sat down at the right hand of God to rule over all things.

Tandanên yu, pawa yukun kaawyun. Agana kaw pun mita sa Jerusalem anggan a yu pun natanggap pa kapangyarian ubat sa langit.” Pamakayari, nagdakey ya si Jesus sa langit. Tinêmpanan yan ulap kabay a layna nakit. Niknu si Jesus sa êtêb panabtab Bapan Namalyari amên mamaalay na sa kaganawan bagay.
