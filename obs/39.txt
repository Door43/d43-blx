It was now the middle of the night. The soldiers led Jesus to the house of the high priest in order for the high priest to question him. Peter followed far behind them. When Jesus was taken into the house, Peter stayed outside and warmed himself by a fire.

Bunak kan yabi ya  abitu sabitun gintan mani sundalus si Jesus  sa balin puun pari amen patangen ya. Nangamat kana si Pedru nuwa idi ya sa marayu. Sen idi ya sa balin puun pari si Jesus nalakwan   si Pedru sa lawasan. Nakiawyun ya sa mani mag-atug  amen mimudu.

Inside the house, the Jewish leaders put Jesus on trial. They brought many false witnesses who lied about him. However, their statements did not agree with each other, so the Jewish leaders could not prove he was guilty of anything. Jesus did not say anything.

Sa lalen bali, inlitis  mani puun Judiu si Jesus. Dilag silan mani kaawyun na mangalaram ma magpapeteg.  Pakan ase pariparisuy pansabin la, kabay ala mapagpapetgan na taganan nagkasalanan si Jesus.  Pakatewek kaman  si Jesus.

Finally, the high priest looked directly at Jesus and said, "Tell us, are you the Messiah, the Son of the living God?"

Sa katatalwiyan pinatang ngan  puun pari si Jesus,”Sabin muti kanyan nu sikaynay  Mamiligtas sa lumateng, ya Anak Bapan Namalyari ya nabyay?”

Jesus said, "I am, and you will see me seated with God and coming from heaven." The high priest tore his clothes in anger and shouted to the other religious leaders, "We do not need any more witnesses! You have heard him say that he is the Son of God. What is your judgment?"

Nakitbay si Jesus, “Siku yabay, buy makitan mukun nakaiknu sa eteb panabtab Bapan Namalyari buy mallumateng ya dilag kapangyarian ubat sa langit.” Gininit puun pari ya yaming Jesus gawan sa sadyay tubag na. Nan-angaw ya, “A tamina kaylangan ya magpapeteg. Nalenge yinay sinabi na ya sabay siya kanuy  Anak Bapan Namalyari. Sabet ta iatul yu kana?”

The Jewish leaders all answered the high priest, "He deserves to die!" Then they blindfolded Jesus, spit on him, hit him, and mocked him.

Nibetek  ya mani pinunun Judiu, sinabi la, “Sepat yan mati!” Tinakpan lay matan Jesus tinupayan, dinuge buy dinustak.

As Peter was waiting outside the house, a servant girl saw him and said to him, "You also were with Jesus!" Peter denied it. Later, another girl said the same thing, and Peter denied it again. Finally, the people said, "We know that you were with Jesus because you both are from Galilee."

Kaban, sa lawasan  bali,  nakitan gisay anak ka babayi si Pedru. Sinabin anak,”Sabay sikay pagkaawyun Jesus!” Inpuglaw Pedru si Jesus. Ase naepeng dilag ga et  anak ka babayi ya nagsabi kanan,”Kaawyun ka yabay Jesus!” nuwa inpuglaw wa et Pedru, sa katatalwiyan sinabin kaatag ga idi baydu,”Kaawyun ka yabay Jesus ta parisu kaw taga Galilea.”

Then Peter vowed, saying, "May God curse me if I know this man!" Immediately, a rooster crowed, and Jesus turned around and looked at Peter.

Insumpan Pedruy, “Parusan nakun Bapan Namalyari nu kilala kuy liyakin abitu!” Tambeng nangkati ya manuk. Agnan  yan inelew Jesus si Pedru.

Peter went away and cried bitterly. Meanwhile, Judas, the betrayer, saw that the Jewish leaders had condemned Jesus to die. Judas became full of sorrow and went away and killed himself.

Nanangis si Pedrun  namita gawan sa sadyay lungkut na. Sen panparusan na si Jesus, nakitan yan Judas ya sabay ya namisupakat kana. Nalungkut ya, buy namita yan naku sa gisay panggitnan buy baydu ya nagpakamati.

Early the next morning, the Jewish leaders brought Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor. They hoped that Pilate would condemn Jesus as guilty and sentence him to be killed. Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?"

Pamakawasak, maranun nan gintan mani puun Judiu si Jesus sa Gobernador un Roma ya si Pilatu. Labay lan atulan kamatyan si Jesus. Pinatang Pilatu si Jesus, “Sika nayi ya arin  mani Judiu?”

Jesus answered, "You have said so, but my kingdom is not an earthly kingdom. If it were, my servants would fight for me. I have come to earth to tell the truth about God. Everyone who loves the truth listens to me." Pilate said, "What is truth?"

Nakitbay si Jesus, “Sikay nay nagsabi,  nuwa alwan baydi sa lutay  kaarian ku.  Gawan nu baydi sa luta, nangun naku pun dayin intanggul mani tagasunul ku. Naku waku baydi sa luta amen sabin sa mani tawuy  kapetegan tungkul  kan Bapan Namalyari. Mallenge kangkuy kaganawan tawuy mangidu sa kapetegan.” Sinabin Pilatu,”Sabet  bay ya  kapetegan?”

After speaking with Jesus, Pilate went out to the crowd and said, "I find no guilt in this man." But the Jewish leaders and the crowd shouted, "Crucify him!" Pilate replied, "He is not guilty." But they shouted even louder. Then Pilate said a third time, "He is not guilty!"

Pamakayari lan nisabin Jesus, pikisabyan  Pilatuy  mani tawu. Sinabi na, “ Ayin kasalanan na tawun ati.” Nuwa  nipan-angaw wa pinunun mani Judiu buy mani tawu, “ Ipaku ya sa krus!” Inuman  sinabin Pilatu, “ Ayin yabay  kasalanan!”  Nuwa ingkakadus lan  nan-angaw. Inuman na et sinabin Pilatu, “Ayin yan kasalanan!”

Pilate became afraid that the crowd would begin to riot, so he agreed to have his soldiers crucify Jesus. The Roman soldiers whipped Jesus and put a royal robe and a crown made of thorns on him. Then they mocked him by saying, "Look, the King of the Jews!"

Nuwa nalimwan Pilatu dat  magulu sa Jerusalem kabay indin na si  Jesus sa mani tawu amen  ipaku la ya sa krus. Inlatikun mani sundalus si Jesus. Pinayamingan la si Jesus un makamal la balabal. Binyanan lan kuruna si Jesus ya diyan sa diwi. Dinustak la et si Jesus, sinabi la,”Elewen yuy  Harin mani Judiu!”
