One day, Peter and John were going to the Temple. As they approached the Temple gate, they saw a crippled man who was begging for money.

Gisay allu,  naku silan Pedru buy  si Juan sa templu.  Baydu sa Templu, dilag pambêgên Mangêd da Pasbul. Dilag gisay liyaki bayduy lumpu ubat ta sa in-anak ya. Allu-allu panggêtan la ya baydu ta amên magpalimus ya sa mani mansumun sa Templu.

Peter looked at the lame man and said, "I do not have any money to give you. But I will give you what I do have. In the name of Jesus, get up and walk!"

Pinakaêlêw yan Pedru buy si Juan. Sinabin Pedru, ““Ayin nakun pera o gintu, nuwa dilag gakun idin kamu. Sa lagyun Jesu Cristu ya taga Nazaret, midêng ka buy mita ka.”

Immediately, God healed the lame man, and he began to walk and jump around, and to praise God. The people in the courtyard of the Temple were amazed.

Tambeng  inumiyul ya  liyaki  ya lumpu. Nibita-bita yan nag-ukdu-ukdun mangulimên kan Bapan Namalyari.  Nakaupapas  ya mani  tawuy idi  sa lawasan templu.

A crowd of people quickly came to see the man who was healed. Peter said to them, "Why are you amazed that this man is healed? We did not heal him through our own power or goodness. Rather, it is the power of Jesus and the faith that Jesus gives that healed this man."

Tambeng  nakuy mani  tawu  amen  elewen na tawuy lumpu ya inumiyul lana.  Sinabin Pedru sa mani tawuy  mititipun,  “ “Mapatêl kun Israelita, uy siyan nakaupapas kaw ya sa nalyari ta? Buy papakaêlêwên yu kay yata? Indap yu nayi nu napabita yan na tawun ati gawan sa sarilin kapangyarian yan o gawan mapanunul kay sa kalabayan Bapan Namalyari? Asê! Inumiyul  ya gawan  sa  panampalataya na kan Jesus.”

"You are the ones who told the Roman governor to kill Jesus. You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. Although you did not understand what you were doing, God used your actions to fulfill the prophecies that the Messiah would suffer and die. So now, repent and turn to God so that your sins will be washed away."

Impapati yuy pangubatan biyay ya ayin katganan, nuwa pinabyay yan Bapan Namalyari.   Tinupad   Bapan Namalyari  ya  ula  tungkul sa Mamiligtas.  Magkasakit buy mati ya.  Kabay magsisi kaw na buy mag-udung kaw kan Bapan Namalyari amên patawarên nay mani kasalanan yu.”

The leaders of the Temple were very upset by what Peter and John were saying. So they arrested them and put them into prison. But many of the people believed Peter's message, and the number of men who believed in Jesus grew to about 5,000.

Nanubag  gaman  kallan pedru buy kan Juan na mani  pinunun Judiu.  Kabay inpadakep lay luwa  buy  impasuku. Paraman baydu, malakê sa mani nallêngê sa pangaral lay nanampalataya kan Jesus. Kabay nidagdag ga bilang la anggan sa niras limay libuy lawyaki.  Dil;ag  et  mani babayi buy  mani anak ka  naniwala kalla.

The next day, the Jewish leaders brought Peter and John to the high priest and the other religious leaders. They asked Peter and John, "By what power did you heal this crippled man?"

Kinawasakan, gintan mani pinunun mani Judiu silan Pedru buy si Juan  sa balin pinakapuun parin Judiu.  Pinatang silan  pari, “ Sisabet ta nam-in karapatan kamuyun  daygen na  dinyag yu sa  templu?”

Peter answered them, "This man stands before you healed by the power of Jesus the Messiah. You crucified Jesus, but God raised him to life again! You rejected him, but there is no other way to be saved except through the power of Jesus!"


Nakitbay  si Pedru, “Si Jesus   ya Mamiligtas ya namaiyul  sa liyakin ati.  Sabay siyay impaku yu sa krus,  nuwan  inuman yan pinabyay Bapan Namalyari! A yu ya tinanggap nuwa  ase miligtas  ya agyan sisabet man  nu alwan sa kapamilatan  Jesus!”

The leaders were shocked that Peter and John spoke so boldly because they could see that these men were ordinary men who were uneducated. But then they remembered that these men had been with Jesus. After they threatened Peter and John, they let them go.

Nakaupapas sa mani pinunun mani Judiu,  sên natandan lay kay nayêpay pangatawu lan Pedru buy si Juan buy a sila nag-aral, nakaupapas sila sa kapas-êyan nakêm la. Naisip lay sabay sila bay-in na pagkaawyun Jesus.  Kabay  pinalimu la  silan Pedru buy  si Juan bayu inpatas.
