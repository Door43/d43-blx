Every year, the Jews celebrated the Passover. This was a celebration of how God had saved their ancestors from slavery in Egypt many centuries earlier. About three years after Jesus first began preaching and teaching publicly, Jesus told his disciples that he wanted to celebrate this Passover with them in Jerusalem, and that he would be killed there.

Tatluy tawun  nan mangaral Jesus. Marani yay Pestan Kaligtasan.  Ya pestan abiin sabay  ya pagkalutun  Mani Judiu  nu parasaantu silan inligtas Bapan Namalyari sa  pangaipus la sa Egiptu dinadinalan nay tawun na nilabas.  Tandan Jesus nu sabet  ta malyari kana sa Jerusalem nu saantu ya ipapati.

One of Jesus' disciples was a man named Judas. Judas was in charge of the apostles' moneybag, but he loved money and often stole money out of the bag. After Jesus and the disciples arrived in Jerusalem, Judas went to the Jewish leaders and offered to betray Jesus to them in exchange for money. He knew that the Jewish leaders denied that Jesus was the Messiah and that they were plotting to kill him. 

Ase kalabay maniwalay mani Pariseu ya si  Jesus ya  lumateng nga Maliligtas.  Nun a namalanu sila pun  nu parasaantu yan   ipapati.  Dilag  gisa sa mani tagasunul Jesus ya manalan  pera sabay  si Judas.  Pawa yan  manakaw sa peray pantalanen na gawan lupa yan pera. Gisay allu,   naku si Judas sa mani pinunun mani Judiu buy  nakisawupan  ya  kalla nu parasaantun madakep si Jesus.

The Jewish leaders, led by the high priest, paid Judas thirty silver coins to betray Jesus. This happened just as the prophets had predicted. Judas agreed, took the money, and went away. He began looking for an opportunity to help them arrest Jesus.

Namayad sila kan  Judas un tatlumpuy bis-il pilak. Nalyari ya ati kaparisun sinabin mani propeta. Nakalabay si Judas,  buy nimita yan gintan nay pera.  Nangkap yan paralan nu parasaantun madakep si Jesus.

In Jerusalem, Jesus celebrated the Passover with his disciples. During the Passover meal, Jesus took some bread and broke it. He said, "Take and eat this. This is my body, which is given for you. Do this to remember me." In this way, Jesus said that his body would be sacrificed for them.

Kaawyun Jesus ya mani tagasunul na sabitun nagkalutu sila sa Pestan Kaligtasan. Kaban mangan sila kingwan Jesus ya tinapay buy binis-il, sinabi na, “ Kewen yu  buy kanen  na ati ya  tinapay.  Ati  ya lawini ku ya binis-il bis-il ku  para kamuyu.  Daygen yuy ati  bilang pangganaka  kangku. “ Pan-itusek   Jesus  ya sarili nan lawini ya sabay ya idin na para kalla.

Then Jesus picked up a cup and said, "Drink this. It is my blood of the New Covenant that is poured out for the forgiveness of sins. Do this to remember me every time you drink it." 

Pamakayari, kinwan Jesus ya alak. Sinabi na,”Inemen yuy ati. Ati ya daya kuy pan-idin ku  amen mapatawad da mani kasalanan tawu. Ati ya Bayuy Kasunduwan ya pandaygen ku para  kamuyu. Daygen yuy ati bilang  pangganaka yu kangku.” Pan-itusek kallan Jesus ya sabay ya daya nay  idin na amen mapatawad da mani kasalanan mani tawu.

Then Jesus said to the disciples, "One of you will betray me." The disciples were shocked, and asked who would do such a thing. Jesus said, "The person to whom I give this piece of bread is the betrayer." Then he gave the bread to Judas.

Pamakayari, sinabin  Jesus, “Gisa kamuyuy mamisupakat kangku.” Nakategag ga mani tagasunul na. A la maiisip ya dilag manyag parabaydu kan Jesus. Sinabin Jesus, “Si tawuy biyan kun ati ya tinapay sabay ya mamisupakat kangku.” Pamakayari, indin nay tinapay kan Judas.

After Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. Judas left and went to help the Jewish leaders arrest Jesus. It was nighttime.

Sen naekan nan Judas ya tinapay, sinumun na kana si Satanas. Namita ya buy nakisawupan ya sa mani pinunun mani Judiu amen madakep la si Jesus.  Yabi yanay abitu.

After the meal, Jesus and his disciples walked to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said, "You will all abandon me tonight. It is written, 'I will strike the shepherd and all the sheep will be scattered.'"

Pamakayari lan nangan, naku si Jesus buy mani tagasunul na sa Bung-uy mani Ulibu. Sinabin Jesus, “Sa yabin ati lakwanan yuku kaparisun nakasulat sa Sabin Bapan Namalyari,”‘Patin kuy pastul buy mikyat ta mani tupa.’

Peter replied, "Even if all the others abandon you, I will not!" Then Jesus said to Peter, "Satan wants to have all of you, but I have prayed for you, Peter, that your faith will not fail. Even so, tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny that you even know me three times."

Nakitbay si Pedru, “Agyan lakwanan kaw kaganawan, a kataw lakwanan!” 

Sinabin Jesus kan Pedru, “Labay Satanas ya kewen nakaw kaganawan, nuwa manalangin naku para kamuy Pedru amen ase mitas ya panampalataya mu. Paraman baydu, sa yabin ati bayu mangkati ya manuk,  katitlu mukun ipuglaw.” 

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-38-10.jpg}}

Peter then said to Jesus, "Even if I must die, I will never deny you!" All the other disciples said the same thing.

Nuwa insabi pun et Pedruy, “A kata ipuglaw, agyan patin nakun kaawyun mu.” Para et bayduy sinabin kaatag pun na mani  tagasunul.

Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. Jesus told his disciples to pray that they would not enter into temptation. Then Jesus went to pray by himself.

Naku   sila sa lugal la pambegen Getsemani.  Sinabin Jesus  kalla, “ Manalangin kaw amen  a kaw masambut Satanas.” Pamakayari, nagpakarayu yan perad amen manalangin.

Jesus prayed three times, "My Father, if it is possible, please let me not have to drink this cup of suffering. But if there is no other way for people's sins to be forgiven, then let your will be done." Jesus was very troubled and his sweat was like drops of blood. God sent an angel to strengthen him.

Katitlun nanalangin Jesus, “Bapa ku, nu malyari, itas mu dayi kangkuy mani kasakitan na lumatêng. Nuwa para man bayduy alwan kalabayan kuy masunul, nun a ya kalabayan mu.”  Gawan sa sadyay kalungkutan  Jesus nantuluy sayngit nan  paray nan daya.  Namiutus si Bapan Namalyari mani ang-el amen papas-eyen na nakem na.

After each time of prayer, Jesus came back to his disciples, but they were asleep. When he returned the third time, Jesus said, "Wake up! My betrayer is here."

Balang pamakayarin manalangin si Jesu,  mag-udung  ya sa mani tagasunul na buy  makitan nan  kay pawa silan  mamabelew.  Sa katitlun pag-udung na, sinabi  na, “Mimata kaw! Abiti yay tawuy mamipadakêp kangku.”

Judas came with the Jewish leaders, soldiers, and a large crowd. They were carrying swords and clubs. Judas came to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Teacher," and kissed him. This was the sign for the Jewish leaders to know whom to arrest. Then Jesus said, "Judas, do you betray me with a kiss?"

Kaawyun  inlumateng  Judas ya mani pinunun mani Judiu, mani sundalus buy malakey tawu ya dilag gegtan na keya buy pamatuk.  Nagdani si Judas kan Jesus buy sinabi na, “ Manged da yabi kamuy, Manuru” Agnan  pandep na kan Jesus.  Ati ya tanda'  amen matandan mani kaawyun na nu sisabet ta dakpen. Sinabin Jesus kana,” Judas, sabay  nayi ya  abiin na tanda' sa  pamisupakat mu kangku”?

As the soldiers arrested Jesus, Peter pulled out his sword and cut off the ear of a servant of the high priest. Jesus said, "Put the sword away! I could ask the Father for an army of angels to defend me. But I must obey my Father." Then Jesus healed the man's ear. After Jesus was arrested, all the disciples ran away.

Sen  dinakep  mani sundalus si Jesus, nanganus kêya si Pedru  buy pinutus nay têk ipus puun pari.  Naputus nay tek ipus. Sinabin Jesus,  “Isakeb muy abiin na  keya mu! Amu nayi tanday malyari yakun manyawad libulibuy ang-el  sa Bapa ku amen itanggul laku? Nuwa kaylangan kun sunulun na Bapa ku. “Pamakayari pinaiyul Jesus ya tek  ipus.  Nipamwayuy mani tagasunul na buy inlakwanan yan kaganawan.
