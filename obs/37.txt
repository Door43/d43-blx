One day, Jesus received a message that Lazarus was very sick. Lazarus and his two sisters, Mary and Martha, were close friends of Jesus. When Jesus heard this news, he said, "This sickness will not end in death, but it is for the glory of God." Jesus loved his friends, but he waited where he was for two days.

Gisay allu, nabalitan  Jesus  ya nagsakit  si Lazaru ya  kaluguran na un asina maagasan.   Si  ati  si Lazaru dilag yan luway patel la babayi,  si  Marta  buy si Maria, ya  kaluguran et Jesus.  Sen natandan  Jesus sa ati, sinabi na,  “Ya sakit ta idi kana alwan kamatyan na kayaryan na, nun a amên maparangalan si Bapan Namalyari. Buy sa kapamilatan abiin, maparangalan naku êt ta Anak Bapan Namalyari.”   Kaidwan  Jesus  ya mani kaluguran na, nuwa  nabuyutan nan luway allu bayu  na inlaku si Lazaru.

After the two days had passed, Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's go back to Judea." "But Teacher," the disciples answered, "Just a short time ago the people there wanted to kill you!" Jesus said, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, and I must wake him."

Sinabin Jesus  sa mani tagasunul  na, “Mag-udung kitamina sa prubinsyan Judea.” Nakitbay ya mani tagasunul, “Manuru, uy siyan labay mu yan mag-udung ka sa Judea ta pakan dakun nakanu pun, labay kan batwan mani Judiu baydu.”  Sinabin Jesus, “Ya kaluguran tamuy si Lazarus, mamabêlêw ya. Nuwa lakwên ku ya amên pêwên.”

Jesus' disciples replied, "Master, if Lazarus is sleeping, then he will get better." Then Jesus told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead. I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe in me."

Sinabin  mani tagasunul Jesus,  “Panginuun, nu kay mamabêlêw ya, umiyul ya pun.”  Kabay sinabi yan Jesus,  “Nati ya si Lazaru.  Nuwa magpasalamat takun ayin naku baydu amên sa kapamilatan daygên ku, lakwas kaw pun manampalataya kangku.”

When Jesus arrived at Lazarus' hometown, Lazarus had already been dead for four days. Martha went out to meet Jesus and said, "Master, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died. But I believe God will give you whatever you ask from him."

Pamakalateng  Jesus, apatta alluy nan nati  si Lazaru.  Timbeng  yan Marta buy sinabi na, “Panginuun nu idi kata dayi baydi, asê dayi nati si Lazaru ya patêl ku.  Nuwa paraman baydu, agyan amêsên, tanda kuy agyan sabêt man na yawadên mu kan Bapan Namalyari, idin na kamu.”

Jesus replied, "I am the Resurrection and the Life. Whoever believes in me will live, even though he dies. Everyone who believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?" Martha answered, "Yes, Master! I believe you are the Messiah, the Son of God."

Sinabin Jesus, “Sikuy mam-in biyay buy sikuy mamabyay manguman sa mani nati. Ya manampalataya kangku, agyan mati ya, manguman yan mabyay.  Sisabet man na manampalataya kangku mabyay  ya  agyan mati ya.  Buy ya manampalataya kangku a yina mati. Maniwala ka nayi sa sinabi ku?”  Nakitbay si Marta, “Awuy Panginuun, manampalataya kun sikay Mamiligtas ya  Anak Bapan Namalyari.”

Then Mary arrived. She fell at the feet of Jesus and said, "Master, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died." Jesus asked them, "Where have you put Lazarus?" They told him, "In the tomb. Come and see." Then Jesus wept.

Pamakayari inlumateng ngaman si Maria.  Nanduku ya sa arapan Jesus buy sinabi nay, “Panginuun, nu idi kata dayi baydi, asê dayi nati ya patêl ku.”  Pinatang silan Jesus, “Antuy pinilbengan yu kan Lazaru?” Nakitbay sila, “Baydu  sa pamilbengan.  Kaksaw kay Panginuun amen  makitan  mu ya.” Nakatangis  si Jesus.

The tomb was a cave with a stone rolled in front of its opening. When Jesus arrived at the tomb, he told them, "Roll the stone away." But Martha said, "He has been dead for four days. There will be a bad smell."

Ya pamilbengan la gisay leyang nga nagtakep maragul la batu.  Pamakalateng Jesus sa pamilbengan, sinabi nay,”Itas yuy batu.” Nuwa nakitbay si Marta, “Panginuun,  dat nabatay na ta  apattay  allu nan  nakalbeng.”

Jesus responded, "Did I not tell you that you would see God's glory if you believe in me?" So they rolled the stone away.

Nakitbay si Jesus, “Alwa nayin sinabi ku kamuy makitan muy kapangyarian  Bapan Namalyari nu  manampalataya ka?” Kabay intas lay batu.

Then Jesus looked up to heaven and said, "Father, thank you for hearing me. I know you always listen to me, but I say this for the sake of all these people standing here, so that they will believe you sent me." Then Jesus shouted, "Lazarus, come out!"

Naningla sa langit  si Jesus buy sinabi na, “Bapa, magpasalamat taku kamu, gawan inlêngê muku.  Tanda kuy pawa mukun pallêng-ên, nuwa pansabin kuy ati un masnêg para sa ikakangêd mani idi sa palitêng ku amên manampalataya silan sikay namiutus kangku.”  Buy  bineg Jesus si Lazaru,”Lazaru, mag-awas ka!”

So Lazarus came out! He was still wrapped in grave clothes. Jesus told them, "Help him take off those grave clothes and release him!" Many of the Jews believed in Jesus because of this miracle.

Kabay nagsalwang yabay si Lazaru ya nakabêlêbêl pun telay paglêbêng. Kabay sinabin Jesus kalla, “Itas yuy telay nakabêlêbêl kana amên makabita ya.”  Malakey Judiuy nakakit sa dinyag Jesus  kabay nanampalataya sila kana.

But the religious leaders of the Jews were jealous, so they gathered together to plan how they could kill Jesus and Lazarus.

Nuwa kinaseman mani  Pariseu si Jesus. Kabay nititipun silan namalanu nu parasaantu lan ipapati si Jesus buy si Lazaru.
