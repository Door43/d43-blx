Then Jesus told the disciples to get into the boat and sail to the other side of the lake while he dismissed the crowd. After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he went up on a mountainside to pray. Jesus was there all alone, and he prayed until late at night.

Pamakayari, inpasakay Jesus sa bangka ya mani tagasunul na, buy inpaunan lumipay sa Betsaida buy inpauli nay kalak-an. Sên nakabitay nay mani tawu, sinumukpa si Jesus sa gisay bung-uy amên manalangin.

Meanwhile, the disciples were rowing their boat, but by late in the night they had only reached the middle of the lake. They were rowing with great difficulty because the wind was blowing hard against them. 

Kaban idi pun sa bunak dagat ya bangkan mani tagasunul na, magkasakit ya mani tagasunul na sa pagsagwan, gawan salungat sila sa masikan na bagyu.

Then Jesus finished praying and went to the disciples. He walked on top of the water across the lake toward their boat!

Inlakun Jesus ya mani tagasunul na un mamita sa babun lanêm.

The disciples were very afraid when they saw Jesus, because they thought they were seeing a ghost. Jesus knew that they were afraid, so he called out to them and said, "Do not be afraid. It is I!"

Sên nakit mani tagasunul la dilag mamita sa babun lanêm, kinêdêsan sila gawan sa sadyay limu la. Kabay nakaangaw silan paradi, “Anitu!” Tandan Jesus ya malimu sila. Kabay nagbêg ya, “Agana kaw malimu, ta sikuy ati!”

Then Peter said to Jesus, "Master, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water." Jesus told Peter, "Come!"

Sinabin Pedru kan Jesus, “Panginuun, nu sabay sikay abiin, ipalaku muku baysên un mamita êt sa babun lanêm.”

Nakitbay si Jesus, “Kaksaw ka!”

So, Peter got out of the boat and started walking to Jesus on the surface of the water. But after walking a short distance, he turned his eyes away from Jesus and began to look at the waves and to feel the strong wind.

Kabay nagtabuy si Pedru sa bangka buy namita sa babun lanêm papakun kan Jesus. Nuwa nalimwan na gawan nakit nay malakas sa angin. Kabay a nayna nakitan si Jesus.

Then Peter became afraid and began to sink in the water. He cried out, "Master, save me!" Jesus reached out right away and grabbed him. Then he said to Peter, "You man of little faith, why did you doubt?"

Gawan baysên, nalimwan Pedru buy pakanawa yan nilêbêg. Nan-angaw ya, “Panginuun, iligtas muku!”  Tambêng yan dinwang Jesus buy sinabi na, “Nabêlêng yay panampalataya mu ta! Buy siyan magmitalisa yay nakem mu ta?”

When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind immediately stopped blowing and the water became calm. The disciples were amazed. They worshiped Jesus, saying to him, "Truly, you are the Son of God."

Pamakasakay lan luwa sa bangka, tinunggên na malakas sa angin. Buy inulimên yan mani tagasunul na ya idi sa bangka buy sinabi, “Pêtêg yabay ya sikay Anak Bapan Namalyari!”
