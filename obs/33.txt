One day, Jesus was teaching a very large crowd of people near the shore of the lake. So many people came to hear him that Jesus got into a boat at the edge of the water in order to have enough space to speak to them. He sat in the boat and taught the people.

Gisay allu, malakêy tawuy nititipun sa palitêng na, kabay nagsakay ya sa gisay bangka buy baydu yan niknun nangaral.

Jesus told this story. "A farmer went out to plant some seed. As he was spreading the seeds by hand, some seeds happened to fall on the path, and the birds came and ate all of those seeds."

Paradi ya inkwentun Jesus kalla, ‘Dilag gisay manggitnay namibulaglag bini.  Sa pamibulaglag na, dilag bini ya nangananabu sa dan. Inlumatêng nga mani uybun manuk, tinuktuk lay mani bini.

"Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was very little soil. The seeds in the rocky ground sprouted quickly, but their roots were not able to go deep into the soil. When the sun came up and it got hot, the plants withered and died."

Dilag mani bini ya nanabu sa mabatuy lugal la ayin mayngan luta. Tambêng tinumubuy bini gawan nalayab ba luta.  Nuwa sên naputakan mamut ta ati, nawangêy sila, gawan ayin silan pukat pagyamutan. Kabay nangamamati sila.

"Still other seeds fell among thorn bushes. Those seeds began to grow, but the thorns choked them out. So the plants that grew from the seeds in the thorny ground did not produce any grain."

Dilag mani bini ya nanabu sa lutay pantubwanan têmak ka madiwi. Inlumabung nga mani têmak nuwa si mani bini ya tinubumu asê sinumalaysay.

"Other seeds fell into good soil. These seeds grew up and produced 30, 60, or even 100 times as much grain as the seed that had been planted. He who has ears, let him hear!"

Ya kaatag gaman nanabu sa mangêd da luta. Tinumubu buy dinumagul la mani ati buy nanagêy. Si kaatag, nanagêy titlumpu buy si kaatag tianêmmapu buy si kaatag êt dinalan na lasi.” Sikaw wa mallêngê, pakaisipin yuy abiin!”

This story confused the disciples. So Jesus explained, "The seed is the word of God. The path is a person who hears God's word, but does not understand it, and the devil takes the word away from him."

Impatandan Jesus nu sabêt ta labay sabin abaytuy alimbawa. Sinabi na, “Ya bini, sabay ya sabin Bapan Namalyari.  Ya danin dan, nu saantu nanabuy dakun umnuy bini, sabay ya mani tawuy nallêngên sabin Bapan Namalyari nuwa  a la napukatan. Kabay inlumatêng si Satanas, intas sa nakêm lay sabin Bapan Namalyari.

"The rocky ground is a person who hears God's word and accepts it with joy. But when he experiences hardship or persecution, he falls away."

Ya mabatuy lugal, nu saantu nanabuy kaatag ga mani bini, sabay ya tawuy nakalêngên sabin Bapan Namalyari buy matula lan tinanggap pa ati.   Nuwa sen nakadanas silan   kasakitan buy  pangusig,  ase napeng  nga panampalataya la.

"The thorny ground is a person who hears God's word, but as time passes, the cares, riches, and pleasures of life choke out his love for God. As a result, the teaching he heard does not produce fruit."

Ya lutay dilag têmak ka madiwi, nu saantu nangananabuy kaatag bini, sabay ya nakalêngên sabin Bapan Namalyari. Nuwa sên napeng  ngana, nalabayan lay nay mani pangganakên sa biyay la, pibandiyan buy panunul sa kalabayan lawini la. Kabay a nanagêy ya panampalataya la.

"But the good soil is a person who hears the word of God, believes it, and produces fruit."

Nuwa si bini ya nanabu sa matabay luta, sabay ya mani tawuy nallêngên sabin Bapan Namalyari ya dilag mangêd da nakêm. Intanêm lay ati sa bêkê la buy pinibabatan lan sinunul angga sa nanagêy.
